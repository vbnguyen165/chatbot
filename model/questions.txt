For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them.  That was his job.
No shit.
You don't get it, do you?
What?
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
So, like, where is she?
You got about five minutes and change.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
Just twelve.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
Hi again, how's it going?
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Who?
Bernie, how'sa kid?
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do?
I'm with an very important client.
I think  it's worse  now.
That always used to work.
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
Well...
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
Your father never means to be so...
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Some kids were teasing you?
There's no room.
What time did you say they would be there?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Any bodyguards?
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
When do we go?
My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you?
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
Your parents met her.
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
What?
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
It looks delicious.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
You're intolerable today.
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
What's that?  I hear something!
You hear trouble.
You wanna split?
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
You look a little shaken.
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Last night? What do you mean?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
No, I have my things in the car.
Party without me.
When'd they file the demur?
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
You'd have been proud of her.
I'm sure.
She was a revelation...
To you, too?
What do you mean?
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
That's beside the point.
Hood residence.
Charles, what time is it?
Is this Charles?
What time is it?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
And?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Right.
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
What the hell you doin' back there?
Seal the cave?
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
What can I get you?
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
Nostrovia.
La'chiem.
Slanta.
Rinka.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
What did you say? What did you do?
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
Clear him off the road.
How long until the army is ready?
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
That bad huh?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
Is it bad?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
I didn't.
How much we looking for?
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
You haven't smoked in two years.
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
He's bringing a girl?
Miracles do happen.
Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
That so?
Out?
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
What do they do up there?
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
Hi...
Hi... am I late?
Good-bye.
Have you got it?
Let's talk some more first.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Uh-huh.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
And why do you say that?
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
... bottle ...
Red ...
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
The Websters.
The Websters!
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
What?!
Harlan.
What?!  What about him?!
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
No.
Every suicide kills two.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Don't shoot yourself.
Why?
Fightings a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
Are you expecting anyone?
Yes, Sue?  What is it?
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
Ouch.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
Aw... that's so sweet.
I love you.
What is it?
God, you have great legs.
Shoot me. 
 What's it say? 
Forty-nine point four.
Duff, I love you.
You slept with her!
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
You put everything on the line because you...
Structural damage at 68 percent.
Do I have to do this?
Shit.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
What did it look like?
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
Why are you here?
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
I see.
I'm not even sure why.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. Its your job. Its who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?
A building?
Is that... machine...?
It's gone now.
Where are we?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
What time of year?
But don't pull that again.
What's the *medical* explanation?
My money's in that office, right?
Uh-huh.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
No.
You sure?
Yes.
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
Can I see what you did so far?
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
Sorry.  Not today.
But we have to match the other sketch.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
Be specific.
Let's hear it.
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
That'll blow the ship up.
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Yeah, geography.
Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
Who?
Oveur.
Oh my God.
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
I know.
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
I just can't believe it.
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
What is THAT!
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
You know how I feel?
Don't say that.
And number three, Dolly.
Uh... two shooters!
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Well, how about this?
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
At least you walked.
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
What's our deal?
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Yes.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
No, I understand.
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
You took Bill.
It's my nature.
When did this happen?
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
Yes.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
There are no stories anymore.
He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
What do you mean?
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
Dream on!
Maura!
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
Getting married.
To him? He's a sick freak.
He's passionate.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Marylin! Listen to me.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
But why him?
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
You're so bossy.
Holy shit!
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
How could this happen?
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
What can I do about it?
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Yes.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
Bye-bye, boys.
Have fun storming the castle.
Think it'll work?
It would take a miracle. Bye!
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
I've heard of it.
Paulie's gonna make him?
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Fuckin, Zookerman --
Thank you.
Want a spike in it?
I don't believe this is happening...
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
... Aye sir...?
What is our condition?
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
No class.
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
That's what was estimated.
Jeffrey?
Yes?
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
We can reach an understanding on this.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
I'm not.
Did you make me a tape?
I already made you two tapes.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
Why?
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
Third.  What you're going to do with your third.
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
Good book, huh?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Same one you were reading the other night?
What night?
When you didn't come to the club.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
I called, you know.
Called? When?
From the club. You didn't answer.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
I know. Put Scott through college.
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
I want them thrown in jail.
That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
You like them, don't you, Boss.
Okay. I wish you could come.
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
Where is it?
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
The baseball is mine.
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
Have they sat down?
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
Plissken...?
I'm here.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Why don't you go make some coffee.
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
A man with a death wish.
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
Did you see my present for you?
No, where is it?
On your pillow.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
I know.  How long will you be gone?
Just a few days.
Will you take me?
I can't.
Why do you have to go?
To do business.
I can help you.
Got 'cha!
Well...
Yes?
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
Okay.
Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
Andy!
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
You got your vest?
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
So do I.  So do you.
Great
Betsy, come over here a moment.
What is it? I'm busy.
Then it's over.
Uh ... Randall -- ?
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
There has to be!
So far away? In Xenia?
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
Say, Schulz --
Jawohl?
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Jawohl.
Then droppen Sie dead!
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
You did not ask me.
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
212  CONTINUED:
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
So what are you going to do about it?
What do you want me to do?
He... Sam Lombardo?
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
I am the mighty ape!
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
How could he?
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Nine hundred...
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
Well, there's got to be a way...
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
No, you listen. Get out!
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
For certain, no.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
Now, Fran --
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
You make the plate?
What plate?
The license!  You get it?!
No.
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Did you make the plate?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
How long are you staying?
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Was that difficult to get?
What do you want to know?
Your name. And --
Judy Barton.
Who you are --
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
-- and how you happen to be living here.
It's a place to live, that's all.
But you haven't lived here long.
About three years.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
I told you! Right here!
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Where is this broad?
You should learn a little patience.
Is that right?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
No.
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
No.
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
It's been a long time.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
Don't come back, either.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
Flaws.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
You got something to say, Jos, let's hear it.
Man overboard!
Boy overboard!
Herb wants to see me?
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish  to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
I think it's time.
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
Hey Charlie.
Hey Rob.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Huh?
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
The day of our homicides.
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Anybody see ya?
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
They're stragglin'.
You don't remember.
No...
Do you remember where you were?
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Where were you?
Wizard!
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Mine too.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Can we make out now?
Kalen...
Mara...?
I'm just so lonely.
C'mon. I've got the car.
To the Brick Kremlin!
She'll never forgive me!
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
Well?
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
Later.
What?
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Not know.
I have the whole weekend off.
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
Who are you going to call?
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Yeah?
What are we talking about here?
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
20 minutes?
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
It bought us some time.
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
Oh my God!  Bernie!
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
A match for your son, I think.
A fine match.
What-are they speaking?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
Telegrams.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
Huh?
Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
But he's the head of InGen!
We want to talk to you.
What about?
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
Joey...
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
I'd rather have a knife.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
No.  What am I to do?
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
No one's coming.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
Mine, too.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
...he's the producer of the movie.
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
Doug...
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
I don't mind.
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
How's Jonah taking it?
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
You're kidding --
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
What is that supposed to mean...?
I think its meaning is clear.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
That could be.
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
Is this... food!
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
Bullshit.
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
You've got no jurisdiction.
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
His spiritual mother...
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
Mr. Mulwray, please.
He's not in, Mr.?
Gittes.
May I ask what this is regarding?
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Since lunch.
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
He was expecting you?
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
Because he likes you.
Me?
I... I... KILLED her...
Mom?
Yeah?
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
You're allergic to hay.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
What're these?
I don't know.  What are they?
I found them in your file box.
Must be a spare set.
What did you wish for, Adam?
If he tells, it won't come true!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
He only lasted one season.
Why?
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Helluva idea.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
The other guy drew first.
Why did you give up teaching?
Why didn't you get into bed?
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
Okay. Hi.
So who's the lucky guy?
Who?
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
You took the chalice.
Yes.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
This is not a place you wanna go.
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
Find a chaplain.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
This is so patronizing.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
You're not going up there.
He's seen both of us now.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
You want somethin'?
You Harlin?
Nope.  Darrell.
Harlin around?
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
We need padded chairs.
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
But why?  The students love us!
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
A what?
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
No food?
Look, I don't know what's up there.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
It's for my daughter.
How old is she?
Four.
Standard, modern, upscale --
-- Standard.
Sometimes you just have to -
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
Why do you do that?
What?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
I'm not-
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
Huh?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Just a couple more . . .
And if she runs?
Well.
Benjamin.
Yes?
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Why don't you watch?
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
What?
Take some time off.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
Don't let me go!
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.
Tom, you're all heart.
Promise?
I promise.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
The Metro.
Meet Col --
Oh, for Christ's sake -
...bed.
Oh, no -- no!
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
Well, there's nobody special!
Fine.
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
What?
Meeting ... people.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
Hey! Just remember I made you.
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
You will.
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
They won't.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
We can always do that, Duff.
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Phileas Fogg?
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
They don't have a wine list.
A hacker planted the virus.
Virus?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
Excuse me?
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
God, I think I need a holiday.
Some deal you did there!
got some coffee brewing, huh?
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
-- do you wanna cup?
Sethe?
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
Okay.
Really?
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Is she a good fuck?
What??
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
That's true.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
That's true
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
That's true.
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
What do you say to him?
He's asleep.
Always?
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
The driveway's on my side of the house.
We're talking.
What?
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Now let's keep going here.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Right.
Thank you.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
We don't.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
No we don't.
Well how long has this been going on.
About five years.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
No.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
How many times a year.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Man, is this interesting.
Is it?
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Not exactly.
But you don't hate him.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
I don't.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Is it?
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
Good luck to you, Rose.
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
GWEN?
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
What do you want?
Oh!  You scared me.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
Did they say anything about my family?
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
Are you freaking out?
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
Yah.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
Not yet.
What?
You make it sound so easy.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
Maybe he just went to the store.
Hi.
Hi.
Please -- please!
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me  Charlie.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
The prom?  Kat has a date?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been looking.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
I always favored the Hulk.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Aw, fuck.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Why didn't he shoot you?
What's all this then?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Still in love?
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
Is it okay?
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
And?
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
What's the terrain down there?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Is it solid?
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Then take her down.
Fascist!
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Them who?
You've...
In the car.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Hit me.
"Too young?"
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
"Applicant?"
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
You won?!!!
You've never been sick?
Say goodbye, Mike.
Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
How's he doing?
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
I do.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Tell him why we moved here.
Hold it, Jim.
You can't protect me.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Blast it, I'm already awake!
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
Who's leading them?
I'm no good.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
I have to ask you for that key.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
Forget it.
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Oh you do, huh?
Just a little something' somethin'.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
No, before my time.
You don't read, do you?
Never read a book in my whole life.
Maybe you need to start.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
What monster?
It's mine.  Talley.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
It's ONE of these.
We're going to freeze to death.
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Oh, do yuh?
Yes.
Yeah?
Mr. Malkovich?
Who's calling?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
How'd you get this number?
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
See that wasn't so bad.
It was nothing.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Okay.
Is he staying here?
You're kiddin' me.
How will you do our love scenes?
Body double.
For her?
What are you doing?
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
Sounds boring.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
Don't talk about my wife.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
I don't know.
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Me neither.
Let the law --
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
I understand.
I love you, my brother.
What've you got there?
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
A what?
What in the hell did you do that for?
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
So what's the deal?
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
...I know.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
I <u>think</u> I see it.
How do I offend, my lord?
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Down, honey, down.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
I like that.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
There's one major hole in your story.
Which is?
Like?
We've been through this.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Well, why not?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Lyndon Johnson?
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Tsch.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
No doubt about that one.
How about Magruder?
He checks too.
That leaves two strangers.
So far.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
It was so real...
Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.
Who are you?
Let me talk to the lady again.
There's no lady here.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Hold on.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
Talk to me.
You and Kay were like sisters?
That's what I said.
Dr. Grey.
Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out!
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
I don't think so. It's nice.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
Dylan, where's the man?
What?
What do we do with all these people?
Marg!
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
Any chance we can do that again?
Antonia?
What'd you bit me for!!
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
It's a lie!
Mr. Cedar!
Okay, I'll take it all.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
It'll only work for one of us.
Yes, sir.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
What happened to your hand?
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
Got any requests?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I got you covered.
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
That's comforting.
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
You stayin' in or not?
I'm in.
That was a googly!
I know.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
This a con?
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Few minutes?
...Ten minutes.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
It wouldn't work.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
Two.
Are there many windows?
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
He was.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Are you there?
Yes.
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
What cop?
Boo.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Did you have affairs?
Mr. Gittes.
Did he know?
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
Frankie!
What are you doing?
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
What to the rebels want?
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
No it's not. It was Jason.
Afraid not.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
And it meant something.
Why?
I just wondered.
Just wondered what?
Why.
Why what?
Why you have to go out there.
I don't have to. I want to.
Is it the money?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
I just asked a simple question.
Who told you you could sit down here?
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
According to the map, we're just about at school.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
What's that honey?
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
What?  What popped in there?
That's enough of that.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
But you don't mind.
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
How did we get here?
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
I think think a lie stinks.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
Think she'll hold?
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
There's a vague similarity.
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
That's it!
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
What?
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
Calm down, you're not ...
You okay, man?
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
Really? Why?
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
You burned the score?
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
How fortunate.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
With all my heart, Mozart.
What an asshole.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
That was so demeaning...
She smiled, baby.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I know she's coming back.
I don't think so.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
You think so?
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
She likes you.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
I don't know...
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
That's bullshit.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
...gotta...
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
Wow.
And who may you be?
Edward Wood, Sir.
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
H-how'd you know?!
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Did you get some sleep?
Sure.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Where's the girl?
Upstairs. Why?
I want to see her.
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
So we on tomorrow night?
Grab your socks....
You sure you know how to do this.
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
One year...almost one year.
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
That don't seem fair.
Yes, MCP.
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
Less ten percent.
Yes?
That you, Rog?
Yes?
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
Look, we can do other things.
THX!
Had enough?
A big one....
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
I, actually yes.
I love Jewish men.
Why?
Yes, ma'am.
As far as -- Sonora?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Fucking drunk, huh?
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
You're out of your mind.
Can't we move any faster?
Do you want me to say I did it?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
It's nothing.  Really.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
That a fact?
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
Yes, I have.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
Nothin'. 
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
I'll keep that in mind.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
Nice to run into you again.
What's in your socks?
-- you are.
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
Would Walter really press charges?
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
I'm just here with another girl.
Where you going now?
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
I'll see you around.
I . . .
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
He'll have you -- and Tom.
No. That's all finished.
I'm sorry.
What are you talking about?
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
I don't know ...
Please.
Tim, what are you talking about?
What'd you see?
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
And you met Mary how?
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
How'd you manage that one?
Friend. Baseball bat.
Nice.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
That's impossible.
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
Dad--
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
Do you like music?
Yes, I do -- very much.
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
Of course, my dear.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
The kid needs a man to show him --
What is it, Ninotchka?
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
Look at this.
What is it?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
I used to, but I stopped.
You stopped?  Why?
Because I don't want cancer.
Now, what was that?
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
...isn't it perfect!
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
This I know, Benny.
There, you see?
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
I just got out here!
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
His only copy?
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
Why?
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
It's called pro bono.
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
It's my bit for the community.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
Where was this?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
Ellis, what have you told them?
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
No.
You like kids.
No, Wes.
There's nobody like that on six.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
How'd you know about that?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
You're not crazy, by the way.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
You didn't jump in.
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
Seemed, not was.
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Here.
What's that?
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
It's kind of late.
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
I'm back from the dead.
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
Mister Biller?
Yeah?
I think we're lost.
You have a map.
Well, I practice a lot...
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Jesus.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
The forager's back.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
I didn't get any chicken.
How come?
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
Yesssss...
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
They was a boy. We made friends.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
It's too big.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
I thought they locked you in your room.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Can you get into the office?
Those people are trying to kill us!
I know, Dad!
It's a new experience for me.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
Whose show was this on?
Jed's got cables.
Hello.
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
What happened?
In my bed.
Your bed?
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Why did you phrase it like that?
Like what?
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
He was different.
How different?
As different as it's possible to be.
Tell me about him.
No.
Shouldn't I go?
The team is in mourning, darling.
What is it, Daddy --?
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
You don't even know him.
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
Hello, Peter.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
I am beautiful, aren't I?
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well...
Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
No, I got it. It's okay.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?
I.  Yes.  It is.
And you wrote that...
Yes.
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
Did you like her to watch?
Do you think I told her to kill You?
No.
I'm worn out.
Just stay in bed and rest.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
Why's that?
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
How soon?
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Where you staying now?
Chris! Tell me some good news.
Tell me some bad news?
I don't want to ruin your day.
That bad?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
So I hear.
Huh?
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
Tim, Tim, Tim....
Oh, I hate the other kind.
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
You don't believe that.
Hardly ever.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
It does.
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
Oh!
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
God...
What?
Thank you...
...that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isnt the life I dreamt about.  Wheres the romance, wheres the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you cant have...
Marty, that would alter history.
So what? We'd be rich!
Oh, my God.
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Five million dollars?
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
Not even a guess?
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
The Trail of Tears.
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
So they stayed in Florida?
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
No.
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
Now Amy
It's true.
And who did the voice belong to?
It was just a voice.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Daddy, it's true.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
How did you know that?
What are you still wearing that for?
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
I don't care what she wears.
Something's made you sore.
Don't worry about it.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
Kid--kid--
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
What's this?
Don't!
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
You won't have to.
Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
Thank you, Jack.
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
Hey, Lou.
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
What do you mean?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
Start of what?
Can I help you, sir?
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Eighteen--  and a half.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Sir?
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
What time do you get off work, my child?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
I'm engaged.
Daughter--I love you very much.
You don't even know me.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
This is crazy.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
What do you do for a living?
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
Some kind of animal?
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
what?
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
You think I'm uncomfortable...
Correct.
You really think I'm attractive?
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
No you're not.
I'm not?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Why would I do that?
Is it peace in out time?
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Thank you for saving my life.
That's what they pay me for.
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Look.
No.
Falling.
Why can't it be a ribbon?
Hello.
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
You bitch!
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
What the...?
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
I've had a--
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
That would be too easy.
Too easy?
He's gotta know why.
Come on let's get this coffee.
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
You're crazy.
How's that about your being my friend?
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
What happened?
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
You're kidding.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
Things are kind of confusing.
I'll back that up.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
I wish you wouldn't say that....
What?
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
Monica?  Who's Monica?
What's this?
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
I had to test you.
But you threw a knife at my head!
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
It's very good Bernie.
I want to see Swann face to face.
What's on your mind?
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
You could do that?
Primary circuit is live.
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
C'mon, Laurant, America?
You want to make me look like him...
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
What are you doing?
Do you think I did it?
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
That's not it.  That's not the list.
How many a those things you got now?
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
How you been, Ellis?
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
I am older.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
Didn't know there was any.
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
And you, do you believe?
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Tony.
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her
That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
We don't get many presidential assassins.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
You followed me.
Orders.
To kill me?
What's wrong?
Why so nervous?
I've never done this before.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
So now you'll have a mother.
I don't like her.
I do, she's real funny.
He likes her better than me.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
Then go home, baby.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
Leave then, some friend you are.
You can come to my house for dinner?
No, I'm hiding out.
Who?
Why do they have you tied up here?
Anybody you think is evil?
Yes.
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Nice disguise.
I'm a tourist.
You at least bring the gun?
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
Is he coming?
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
Yes?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Uh...sure...when?
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Now?
Never did catch your name.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
I am not a child.
You are acting like one!
I will be the judge of that.
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
Why?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
That Dave?
Your call is come through.
This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left.
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
I'd like to go back. James...
If Corbett's men find out --
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Vegas, baby!
Is he giving you a check or cash?
Yeah.
They called here after you left...
What?
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
What'd he say?
He told me they knew I was coming here.
What do you mean -- how?
The old man saw it in a dream.
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Always.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
That was close....
Anna, I think you better stay....
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
Hey, man, I'm not--
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
The Gundersons.
The?  Who the fff--
You really wear that suit.
Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
My suitcase was vibrating?
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
But all these people...
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
Can I ask you something?
Shoot.
-- you lose either way, Price --
John's bad.
A year is a long time.
Okay.
That's where the buggy stopped.
The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
What's cookin', Bert?
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
What are you going to do?
Shirelles.
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
Okay.
We might as well pack.
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Claire is your wife?
Yes.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
Mary...
Yes?
Order me a pastrami for after?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Thanks.
More metal... sharp edge...
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
Do it!  Do it!
There's nobody here. Jason...
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
Breathe easy...
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
There is?
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Just relax.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
Who did this?
He's a secretive man.
And you don't ask questions?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
Does that mean...?
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Don't.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
There are limits.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
You better not have too much joy.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.
<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
Hello?
They lied.
`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
I do.  Yes.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
That's not my handwriting.
You've just said you signed it.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
<i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i>
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
Goodbye, my love.
Thorgan, suit up.
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
All right.
I'll getcha a piece.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Oh, you do?
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Oh, right.
Nice car.
Huh?
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Anna.
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
Anna Moss.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Ready, your Honor.
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
No.
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
You're dead.
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
I don't know what you're talking about.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
Way to go, Bob!
I told you they were there.
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
Reverend.
Daddy, I --
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Who are you?
I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
Can't this thing go any faster?
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
They don't know this.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Dad...
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
Run for what?
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
You talk as though you intend on staying.
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Aw, come on, Snake.
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
You like music?
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
A man might what?
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Thank you for calling the white House...
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
While they're strung out?
Frank gone?
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Bull.
Alright, suit yourself.
He's comin' back? What for?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Oh he forced you, huh?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
Thanks, miss.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
Huh?
That's a <u>face</u>???
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
No thanks. I don't drink.
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
Yes.
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
The dynamite...
Dynamite?
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
What does that mean?
It means it was homemade.
This is... really a shock...
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
Who do you think could've done this?
I should do this.
Do what?
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
What is that?
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
Yes.
What did he look like?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
...Who sent you?
Did you bring a check?
What?
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
You got it.
And incidental damages, if any...
You got it.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
You got it.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
You gonna steal my truck?
What!?  What!?
Oh, 'scuse me.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
We're making an investment in Havana.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
I never met them.
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
That's what I'm here for.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
I can't...
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
What about Luther?
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
Yeah?
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
Egon!
Hello, Venkman.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
What!?
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Beat it.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
Crime of passion.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
People get hurt.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
But you were punished.
Yes. I went to jail.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Regret.
What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.
You've done it again?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
What's goosed?
Bandit?
Yeah, guy?
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
What's that?
A videotape.
Who's it from?
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Does it say anything on the tape?
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
Did you see the old man on the ---
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
John, I don't understand any of this.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
John, why?...
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
Said who?  Sugar?
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
I'm sorry, I --
So was he scared?
Hippy, you pussy.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
Stay on your heading, Captain.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
That's an order.
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
You think Drew will go for it?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Don't you work here?
Your two cinnamon rolls.
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Well done, sir. Very neat.
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
What the hell you doing?
Helping him in.
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.


Who did this?
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
What can I do?
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
I... I can't!
You have to...
Good work, Ostreicher.
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
Not even a radio?
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
Hi.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
For going to school?
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Good for her.
I'll take the whole set.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
Dad was onto something here!
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
Nekhorvich's boss?
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
What airport would you use.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Airport.
Well -- where ya goin'?
I don't know.
What, Lewis?
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
With food?
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
Let them take it!
Over my dead body.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
I thank you.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
What did you hear about that thing?
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
No. No. The guy from downtown.
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
Shall I light the candles?
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
You, Zack?
Yes, Sir.

How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
Man this is heavy!
Reporter?
Oh my God ...
Recognize these two characters?
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
What are you doing here?
Checking out the competition.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What else is there?
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
Now you're lying.
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
Sure.
What kind of beer would you like?
I don't know.
They're coming right in.
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
Panther...
Panther!  Same thing...
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Gimme your gun, boy!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Not if I shoot first!
I don't even think you have a gun!
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
No Sir.
Got your license?
Yes.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
I can't sleep nights.
There's porno theatres for that.
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  This dick trying to bushwack me.
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
How long ago did this guy retire?
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
I'd believe him.
Why?
The new girl is here.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
You know what I think?
What?
Here and there. Around.
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Yeah, that's right.
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
Thanks, but I'll manage.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
Did they kill him?
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
Is Mae Rose okay?
She's doing just fine.
And the baby?
He's a big one.
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Oh, he's sitting up.
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
Faith OK?
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
Looks like she was holding out.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
No, sir?
My change.
Change?
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
What?
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
On a good run... yeah.
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!
How much ya wanna bet?
Ten bucks.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".
Poor, yeah.
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Hey... Sheila.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
No.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
What do you think I am -- a crook?
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
Which one of us is she flirting with?
The good-looking one.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
People seem to like my cat.
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Manages what?
His escape.
Oh, but I just told you. --
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
This is the end of the chase.
What did he say?
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
Now, top secret file.
Dr. Green...
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
They're all heavily armed.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
What was it?
Yeah what?!
What's your degree in, dentistry?
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Fundoscopic examination --
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
Having two pints in the Rock.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
Who's Dil?
My special friend.
Oh, yeah.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
The best.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Do you?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
We don't look on it like that.
I've often wondered how you do it.
Depends on what you believe in.
What do you believe in?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
It's as simple as that?
Can I have a word with you?
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
It's all we got.
The bear's got his claws back.
Be smart about it.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
You don't have to wait three days...
...Okay, two...
Jean? Sorbet?
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
If I go to jail...?
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
No... But...
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
It's too far.
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
What are you going to do, Sam?
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
How'm I doing so far?
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Getting ready.
Look. You want to talk about this?
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Understanding of what?
Like I might be in love with another woman.
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
What? Of course I like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Who is your User, program?
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Yeah.
What kind?
Kitchen. . . Technician
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Nope, but --
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Thirty-five.
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
A television set?
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
I know, I'm the fault.
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
What about this week's check?
What's his name, Letty?
You will not come?
No, Holiness.
Am I running away?
Oh, now--
Jefferson--
Yes, Ma?
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
You're an asshole Adam.
You're an asshole.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
Multiple reasons.
Name one.
<u>Jack</u>!
Told you, did he?
How many sisters do you have?
You go first.
Naw, you go first.
You go first.
No.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
You almost sound enthusiastic.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
No.
Yo, I'm gone.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
Shit and fried eggs.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
You know her?
Yes? What?
Captain, what's the next move?
Where are we?
Absolutely.
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
That's a lie!  They still want me!
No, they don't.
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Wanted what?
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
I don't know.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Your guess is as good as mine.
There's fight club in Delaware City.
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
Yes, sir.
One week at the most!?
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
I can't do it.
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
Yes.
Can you walk?
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
Why can't it be her?
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
You - are - a - murderer.
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Well, sir, I putter.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
I just putter.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Zeke.
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
Oh no...
I can't believe I just did that.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
The Conformist.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
You haven't even seen it!
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
I meant --
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
Do you think that's what he wants?
Beautiful!
Hello, Alan.
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
I'm on the scent.
Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
You weren't helpin'.
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
What's wrong with this one?
Is it the one you wanted?
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
This is going to drive the ante up.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
What about bowling?
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
What?
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
What kind of whispering?
You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's 
None of the stewards have seen her.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
Why? Is this about the book?
No. Frank.
Oh, God...
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Huh? Wha...
I can't sleep.
What's he doing?
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
The memory of who?
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
I could get the death penalty.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
Buffy, what are you doing here?
I thought we were meeting here.
I won't be able to stand.
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
Quiet.
A little of both.
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
Where are you going ?
A funeral.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Yeah.
How do you feel about him now ?
I don't know, Zander.
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
You're crazy!
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Stop calling me Max.
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Right, Max. California, Max.
Ah.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Forget it, Max.
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
Agents?
What was that?
He's got those love handles.
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
Man Eater!!!
You mind if I take a look at this?
So you killed your father.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
Well, sure I do.
When'd you see him last?
Today, over at the house.
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
Like you taught me...
Business is good, you're busy?
Yeah, not really.
I saw a picture of you.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
No. I'm the exact opposite --
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
This is a little nuts.
Turn the tapes back on.
So she's pretty cool, huh?
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
No shit?
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
You coming in?
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
So, what are you doing tonight?
Shooting.
Shooting?
CHIP!!
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
Let's go...
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
Wanda...
Oh yeah?
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
Yeah?...
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
I'm busy, man.
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
Four minutes.
What?
I waited another four minutes.
Shit.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
Right.
I'm taking off my mike.
Okay.
Electra --
What?
What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
Bottle-count.
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
I certainly hope not.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
We can do it right here.
Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
What...?
Is this a bad time.
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
What happened...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
How fast?
Twenty-four-five.
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
Who's going to buy me a beer?
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
It sure is.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
See Duff. He's the money man.
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Oh, no, sir!
Good.  You're a good soldier.
You're all right, Argyle.
Strange to be calling yourself.
Maybe it's not me.
Good morning, Treves.
Good morning, sir.
You've acquired a taste for this?
It's quite nutritious, sir.
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
Mother, please...
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
Paillarde of veal.
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
Honey --!
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
Its okay. The cops did it.
I know.
They busted me last week.
They bust you every week.
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
Where do you think you're going?
It's my day off.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
Where are you meeting this person?
At the Zoo.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
I've never been to it.
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
I know it, I know it.
... this doing hair it's...
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
Gabriel, let him go --
Read a lot about you, Nick.
What are you doing here?!
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Gabriel!
A man of some travels.
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
Shit.
What do you want?
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
Are you hungry?
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
Yes -- why?
So, when can we do it?
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Can't do what?
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Jesus, man...
Emily left me this morning.
She's left before...
I'll deal with the police.
Remember what I said, you can't...
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
He ain't Wade.
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
I did.  Is that door locked?
It's locked.
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
You mean "goodnight."
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
Cynthia's not coming?
Oh, Mary . . .
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
For Nicholai?
Yes.
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
Well, I have some paper towels --
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
Is that all the coke in the place?
That's it.
Shit!
The hull's imploding!
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
How old am I?
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
What? He's going to be all right!
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Well, make it stop!
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
You okay?
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Yes.
Class schedule, map, book list.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Neo, this has to be done!
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
What are you talking about?
Dinner, Hubert.
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
They don't want to come down.
So what are you up to now?
Did I say that?
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
What did it smell like?
It was very specific.
All right...
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
What happened after you smelled it?
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
Like she smelled it too?
Yes.
And then what happened?
Robert, do you mind?
What?
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
I don't want to be just your friend --
You don't know what you want --
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
And why would that scare me?
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
It's <u>Otho</u>!
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Then why do you?
Can I do it again tonight?
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
This knife is filthy.
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
How do you know his name?
Did we get it?
We got it.  On your feet.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
I'm walking.
Talking's good, walking's better.
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
Nervous?
Where are you from?
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Finland.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
I'm sorry.
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
I'm saying it now!
So you met somebody else?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
What did I do?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
All I did...
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
Where ya goin'?
Harlin's.
We got any shots?
THANK YOU.
Don't mention it.
You think he did it?
What happened?
Go ahead.
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
Your father?
Yes!
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Do you feel all right, sir?
The little cow is insane --
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
Twenty.
You're in a good mood today, George.
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Chicken salad.
How you feeling?
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
Shush.
Traitor!!
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
What, like some kind of ghost?
Can we get this car there?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
What is what?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
On the contrary.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
No, but I'm the best.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Mozart -
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Mozart -
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Lose something?
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
And--
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
Twenty-seven.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
Really?
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
Who?
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Eric!
Oh no.
What?
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
Eat shit....
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
Apartment 306.
You want me to go up with you?
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
Julia.
Oh my God.
Don't look at me.
Who are you?
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Boy, you must've been up early.
    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Not like that.
Then what?
What have you done to her?
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Which do you think is her best shot...
The one on the left - definitely...
Well, see ya.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
What's that, Diz ?
So you like bookstores, huh?
I like to read.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Sort of, um...
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
What?
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
You're not supposed to...
But I have to!
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Then what is it?
WELL? What are your plans?
Plans?
Lucy.
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
I dont know.
I thought you were an expert.
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
And threw us into the lake.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
You know, that would be like a great thing.
What?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
What are you drunk?
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
What is?!
Show business.
You're in show business?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
Thumbsucker!
I'm making a tape.
Hi.
My lord.
He doesn't remember anything, Delly.  Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...
... including me.  Right?  
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
You mean,  me?
Were they pen pals?
No.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
No.
Did she read the script?
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.
Italian? The Mafia...?
No.
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
You've got to go.
Why?
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
What is it? What happened?
How long since you were here?
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
That's what I call a payday.
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
You get quick action, don't you?
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
But what could she do?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
Well...
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
Promise.
I promise.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
You're not missing much.
It's not enough.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Do you think I should go?
That's up to you.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Yes.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
Still lashed to the mast.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Maybe...?
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
By she, do you mean he?
You're a son of a bitch.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
Say it. We're beat!
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
So what's the problem?
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
If you wake first, wake me up.
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
Shhh.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Howdy Pouty.
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
I told her I loved her.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Restless.
You weren't expecting me?
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
Well, I should be getting...
...It's really getting late.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
Oooh! Here! Here!
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Get him!
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
I said no touching.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Get your hands off of her.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Your dance is over.
We just thought that
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
What I think is going on with your son.
He's gonna miss his flight.
Well I have to come up with  an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
Need a hand?
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Hi, Ray.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
Can't you have a normal conversation?
I don't want to have any conversation.
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
You mean soap?
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Wonder where we'll be then.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Stand by on the ROV.
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Yeah - Josephine.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Oh, George, George, George.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
Oh, George, George!
You have no idea what's happened to me.
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Is this supposed to be an apology?
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
I'm against that.
We've got to get out of this shower.
Now you're making sense.
She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
That's all you meant?
You volunteered for this shit man?
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
So have I.
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
So what'd I miss?
It's Charlie!
Unwise, Holly...
And - Anna...
Did the police believe you?
Can I get that credit card from you?
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Why not?
Because my mom gets the bill.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
I don't want to use it.
Well, then cut it in half.
I keep it for emergencies.
Okay, who's the jerk?
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
I look pretty.
Where are you going?
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Yes?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Virginia.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
That sounds fun.
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Six.
Who are you?
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
Do I know you?
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
The extrovert.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
You want me to leave?
I just want to know why you're here.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
She still is.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
Nope.
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
Nope.
She didn't give you my address?
Nope.
How did you find me?
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
She spoke to me.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
She wiped out her whole family.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Didn't you study it in school?
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
Sheila... Stop...
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
What in God's name...?
I think it's Hawkins.
Where the hell is his body?
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
You wouldn't.
Would.
You couldn't.
Well, go get it then.
Where is it?
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
That's right.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
Right.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
And people make their choice--
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Twenty years, Ma ...
What is that?
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
We'd better talk.
I'm listening.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Would you like to learn them?
I sure would.
Maybe I could start you out.
Mister McMurphy.
Yes, ma'am?
Welcome back.
Thank you, ma'am.
I hope everything is settled.
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
Good shooting, Danny!
Good shooting, Rafe!
Land of the free...
Home of the brave!
...Yeah, go ahead.
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
I don't know it.  I feel it.
You make it sound so simple...
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
You don't.  It goes to court now.
How was it?
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
I'm not sure I can face it.
He says you were scratching.
I wasn't scratching!
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
I see.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
Mutants?!
Yeah.   He's a good man.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
You afraid of the dark?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
More or less.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
What's the matter with you?
Who are you to make assessments?
You don't want any water?
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
Are you on drugs right now?
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
You use their witness.
That's right.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
Terminal?
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
Happy anniversary, baby.
Sorry!
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
Do I know you?
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
GUARD! GUARD!
Alamo...
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
What do you fear?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
I also need someone who can read and write.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
I thought you were an archer?
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
What does it mean?
Can we talk price?
Make me an offer.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
This is your house.
Was it him or you?
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
Is this a joke?
Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
You're beautiful.
Sorry to here it.
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
No.
Mr Brown.
Yes, ma'am.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Yes, ma'am.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
Yes. The lipstick.
Why?
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
I'll go to the Hospital.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Like Rome?
Worse.
You made out alright.
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
The tenth's out.
What?
I can't make the tenth.
What do you mean?
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Be reasonable, Jack.
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
Am I out of here?
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
There were treating me like a headcase.
I've been backpacking.
Huh?
I can use your mom's.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Good morning --
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Here, are you always this sarky?
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Weren't you on a television series?
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Now who's being sarcastic?
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
Hey, mister.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Yes.
We're moving fast considering the storm.
Storm?  What storm?
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
Alex, what is it?
Holding you... again.
Darling.
I need... to talk to you.
All right...
Uhura. Can't you augment?
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
The strip joint?
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Hurry up!  Jump in!
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Don't say anything else.
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
I feel really stupid.
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'.
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
Alright.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
That's certainly possible.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
I have no problem with that.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
The pace?
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
Can you fix it?
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
What do you mean, Dude?
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
By the book, he's a sadist.
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
Yes.
Big through the hips. Roomy.
They all were.
Mmm. And what else...?
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
Was it a butterfly?
A moth... How did you predict that?
Doc!  How the hell are you?
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
It seems to have survived.
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
You're not going to ....
You got no reason to do that!
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
True.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
You and your real estate.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
Well... I think I saw her soul.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
What doesn't?
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
I never said that I believed...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
You need to remember who you're talking to...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
Wesley...
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
Go on, go on--
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--we will--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
...free!
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Did I scare you?
Just one second --
I don't know.
You don't know.
Forget it.
Excuse me?
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
But wait, you don't understand-
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
I don't know, sir.
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
Fuck you!
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
I see it Chewie, hang on.
But...
Can't you stop it?
Thank God!
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
I haven't read that.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
No. Roy. Roy V.
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Seventy-five.
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
There's no one left ...
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Nothing. Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright. 
This doubles my investment.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What, baby?
She left me. She's gone again.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Dammit, Carl!!!!
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
You don't wanna be noticed?
An... entertainer?
Hello.
Sammy.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
It's me.
Don't move!
They're gone. What are you --
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
Why?
Tom.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
No way.
It's what?
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
Who cares? Who cares?
Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
Excuse me?
Just go ahead and tell us.
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
Different worlds, Jack.
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
No.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
You think?
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Mason.
Shit!  Oh, shit. 
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
Why am I here? What happened?
I think we should go...
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
Perfect.
No beauty...
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
You serve martinis, doncha?
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
The...the gold...
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
When did you make the switch?
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
But...
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
That'd be Lily.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
You get it straightened out?
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Thank you so much.
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
She isn't!
That's okay, kid...
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
O-o-o-oh...
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
Let's get outta here.  You want to?
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Oh my God, Steven.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
I'm now begging you.
To win?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
I deserve a lot worse.
It's more
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
She said they were from her old convent.
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Hey, I'm eating.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
You want to be a good detective?
Yes, sir.
250,000?
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
Do they come with batteries?
You didn't buy batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
I can't believe you didn't check.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Fletch, you want an apology?
You were going to can me, right?
Not really.
Not really?
I was upset.
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
Don't you throw up on boat?
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
What kind of deal you looking to?
What's the Blue Book price?
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
That's a lie!!
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
No.
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
What do I get for it?
You get it's brother.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
You know I can't do that.
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
Then change it.
How much closer would you say you were?
I don't remember.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
Hey.
Daddy, what's the matter?
You know what really excites me about you?
What?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
I'm not?
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
But...
When you threw it in, what did you see?
Haven't you heard what I said?
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
No!
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
Mama, shut up!
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
That's all past, Lestat.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
My condolences.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Yeah, weird. But great.
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
Ceremony?
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
How many people do you all feed?
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Get off of me! Stop it!
What...?
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
How far away's the back-up?
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
A coup d'etat?
Oh baby... oh baby...
Now what?
Heard about this morning.
What you been doing?
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
He walked eighteen?!
It's a league record.
Struck out eighteen...
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
Now, Amos, now--  What?
I can't.
Why not?
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
What's your opinion?
I believe Agnes is different.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
That's ridiculous...
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
So, someone else could have done it.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
And in your eyes?
I've already told you what I thought.
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
It's possible isn't it?
Who?
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
I know that.
Jews, yeah.  Investors.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Are you going, too?
She is Lana Turner.
What?
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnt this his case?
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnt with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, hows your mother?
I got a fibrillation!
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
I'm an actress.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
Well, they can be.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Films mainly.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Fifteen million dollars.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
It makes me sad.
What?
I used to live here.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
Which?
How'd you know where to find me?
Elaine.
Te...!
Did I say something wrong?
I suffer from insomnia.
Is that all?
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
Did you hear that?
I heard that.
What the fuck do you want?
These are wonderful.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
What's baseball?
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Like a painting?
No, son. A pitcher.
Like one of Mom's?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
What's that, pal?
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
What if it's during a game?
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
The key!
Key? Key? What is the key?
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
The key!
Where is it? What did you do with it?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
Happily married, probably.
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
Don't leave me.
I have to.
When can I see, you again ?
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
Again???
Me and you are gonna have a talk.
Sez who?
Was your niece about their age?
Not far from it...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
This is a slur on her good name.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
Nobody has any rights over me.
You must allow us to act.
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
Where is it??
You don't want to know.
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Oh God, that's great!
Are you okay?
Martins.
Coming to the point, please.
Thank you.
Who's Strickland?
Really?
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
Aye, sir.
Deanna, on my mark.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
When did he say it, Norma?
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
What?...WHAT!?
A whole lot of nothing.
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
Why LA?
Thank you, Bobby.
You're welcome, Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
I just drove in this morning.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I wanted to apologize.
You do?
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
And then you weren't there.
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
Thank you.
Captain, we got a problem.
Now what?
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
Meurice--
Stay away from me!
I'm not going to hurt you.
What's the matter with her?
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
That's fine, but did you ever think--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
Thank you.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
Never say never.
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
Yes, wasn't it?
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
I'm sure you haven't any.
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Did you finish the interview?
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
Okay.
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
I can try.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
What's with him?
...thirteen fifty six...
What do you think are you're up to?
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Okay.  Lowell?
Yeah?
You're sure you want to do this?
Why?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
You ready...?
You're hurt.
I'll heal.
What about Nomak?
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
He's engaged the override.
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
haka xuki.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
Oh my God.
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
So what?                                                    ]
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
What's that?
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
Well then I guess we should just give up.
There's a Jesse on the phone.
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
So...what's so terrible about that?
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
It matches the pictures.
What the hell are we doing?
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
Colorado's closer
What do you know about my father?
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
Are you trying to seduce me?
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
And so I am.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
New York is dangerous place.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
About what?
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
I'm interested in mythology.
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
I'm a cop from New York.
New York...
What are you doing?
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
It's none of your business.
Rae, all we got is each other.
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
I say a lot of things.
And like a fool I believe it.
Guess they're up.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
What happened to the donut king?
I'm from all over.
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
How many have you lost?
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
And what about the ones you don't save?
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
And what if you can't live with it?
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
Baltus Van Tassel.
Did your father take a loan?
Mommy...?
Major.
Helmuth.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
Yeah.
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
You want me to hold him down?
Peter knows something.
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
You could've asked.
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
So how was school today?
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Do they know yet?
Know what?
Where it came from?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
You have ten seconds.
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Olivier's in that, right?
Hey.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
So don't show a picture.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
...I don't know.
What?
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Yes.
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Oh, God.
Do you see?
Please, no.
'No' what?
Not me.
Are you a man?
Yes.
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
God, no.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
DON'T!
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
Who do you think it is?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
I get all your CDs.
Not my imports.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
Who is he?
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
We want to meet him.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
Who put them up?
The Hunt Club.
Where am I?
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
Steve...
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
That is correct, Major.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
You know the regulations well, Major.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
Hello, Helen!
Matt, come here!
Why?
Who are you?
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Look, I don't know what you want--
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Oh?
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
You're also a fool.
I think you should go now.
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
Put on another one.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
I am well, Admiral.
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
We'll find out soon enough.
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
Opportunities?
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
Why is she trying to kill me?
You got no business snoopin' around --
I haven't been the father to you that --
That you've been to Susan?
I wasn't going to say --
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
What money?
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
In a box under my seat.
Are they heavy?
Yeah.
Abby. What's the matter?
You're vulnerable.
Where you been?
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
What do you want from me?
Hi Norm!
I have no right to answer that.
...up.
Are you kiddin'?

Come on!
Damn.
What the hell's goin' on?
It happens to this piece of shit...
...all the time.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
 Excuse me...
...-ed.
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
Those are the Hoyts.
I don't care. They're out.
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Ticket!  What's going on?
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
Funny guy.
Fuck you - fuck you.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
You two need a time-out.
She's got my vote.
Do you know your parents' blood types?
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
Beaumont Livingston.
I knew it.
No.  There's no way!
Hear me out...
Can we trust him?
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
And the next one...?
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
And the last...?
Do you know why I went after Justine?
She was there...
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
Yes sir?
A room. I'd like a room, please.
A single room or a double room?
A single. Just for myself, please.
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Well...
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Captain, what do you want?
Call me Dudley.
Dudley, what do you want?
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
Yeah, I hate them.
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Where are you going?
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
So, what are we waiting for?
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
You ain't actin', mama.
Ten is standard, sir.
Daddy, what was that noise?
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
There was a bang.
It was the window.
It's cold.
Tell your mother.
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
Oh, God.  I'm awake.
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
You on drugs? Huh?
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Please, if you'd just listen...
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Sure.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
We're very lucky.
He's dead.
Earth... But when?... Spock?
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
I'm too old for this shit.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
Yeah......yeah.....
It's so nice.
Disgraceful.
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Harold?
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
Yeah ... Sort of ...
I need to squeeze this brain.
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
Why?
Hello, John.
Colonel.
Come on, she's getting away.
When was his mother taken?
Last night.
Send him away.
What?
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
How'd it go with the cop?
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
Do you remember where it is?
What?
...When did you know?
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
Yes, sir.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Tell me about it.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
She got off, huh?
It's just a shot to calm you.
No more drugs.  Please...
What city?
Somewhere in Utah.
What's the listing?
Chief says -- how many?
Thousands.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
Just try it.
I said, no thanks.
Feels different doesn't it?
What?
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
What was that?
What's that you carryin'?
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Who's Miss Johnson?
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
I'm in a hurry.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
Still mad at me?
For what.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
Insane.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
Yeah, you were saying?
Edward, did you hear me?
I'm here.
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
Work, work, work, that's all do
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
Story of my life.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
Grant, no!
I loved you. I loved --
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
Get away from me.
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
An old flame?
You talk to Max today?
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
I feel weird asking him.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
No coke tonight.  Right?
A fucking wheelchair?
Hi honey.  What's going on?					*
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
I know she must be a really passionate person.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
Hey--
What?
Nice dress.
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
No, this hurts.
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
My patient had to leave early.
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
So what do you want with her anyway?
I'm a good friend of hers.
How do I know you're not lying.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Probably.  One of the many.
What?
Bunny, not you too?
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
Don't say my name...
I love you, Nick...
Hey there.
...when I... 
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Exactly. They drank it all.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
Six.
How many wings have they got between them?
Twelve.
How many feet?
Er, well, twelve.
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
How the fuck should I know?
What are you bitching about now?
What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
Larry....
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Try an angel.
An angel?
Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?
You know why...with my parents.
Well you can't blame them in a way.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
Why don't you go to the police?
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
Let's not get too idealistic.
Fancy.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Where are my goddamn books?
Books?
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
We didn't find Sounder yet.
He'll show up one day.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Is she a Capulet?
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
Get it out of here!
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
That's easy. Me.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
On his back, I suppose.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
You're too good to me.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
No - not yet.
And I never will- you know what's between us  we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Get it out of here!
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
That's easy. Me.
I thought - is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
On his back, I suppose.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
You're too good to me.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
No  not yet.
And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Clo-Clo?
I got there late, John.
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens 
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
He's a child!
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
You're begging him to kill you?
If he thinks he's man enough.
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
I plan to live one hundred years!
No you don't.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
Honor, I suppose.
What a handsome word.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
Mom.
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
They're all human beings
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Stop, please! I don't know!
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Find out?
Hear the details.
There is no relevant precedent.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
The wire is ten years outa date.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
Oh, la.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
Did you do it?
I think so.
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
Must you walk so quickly?
No.
Why not?
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
Take care, Wade.
How!
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Mom--I'm not--
Sold. Let's go.
... and taxi fare for me.
Get lost.
Yes I am.
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Yes...
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
Would you call this a code 100?
Don't you think you should at least wave?
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
Joel!
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
Where are they?
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
The deal's too good, Frankie
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
I'm willing to take that risk.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
You're --
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
I disagree.
Briefly.
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
I trust your message was received?
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Dock control reports ready, sir.
That was very good.
Thank you.
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Sure. No problem.
Could we try it now?
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Right, sir.
These are your paintings?
What?  Oh yes.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
I'm fine.
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Thank you.
Is there anything I can help you with?
No, just enjoying the view.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
So I've been told.
Jesus...
How well did, er, do you know him?
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
What do you mean, maniacs?
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
What the fuck you looking at?
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
Relax.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Freddie?
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
They knew just where to hit us.
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Where is it?
Excuse me -- what did you say?
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
Thank you.
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
But Richard, no, I, I --
Happy, for reasons there isn't time to go into--it's got to be Miller! We've given you the man. Now write the ticket.  Come on, Joe. Come on, Chick.
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
Get up, Willa.
Harry, what --
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
You okay?  I'm closing.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
No, I'm just going to head home.
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
Huh... 500 meters?
130... 140...
How can you say it?
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
What, for example?
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
Lieutenant --
Call me Vince.
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
So the method of death is the only connection?
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
I'm sorry.
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
It takes time to process --
Was he cheated?
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
They bloody hurt me.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
Why did you come back here?
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
And, what about us?
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
Why did you leave me?
We are losing dorsal shields.
You ought to put a bandage on that.
Where'd they go?
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
Oh?
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
You old-fashioned?
Galvin, look, many years ago...
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Are you done?
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Lugosi?
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Isn't he dead?
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
OUR picture?
The kids take me.
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
But... the silverware?
I use it... to fight evil.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
It is?
I always knew that you were special.
You did?
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
You have no time.  What is your question?
I'm thinking!
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
You are such a wet.
A what?
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Don't start with me again.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
Buffy...
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
We can't stand here all night.
You could go and open the door.
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
Whattaya think you're in now?
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Huh?
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
Do it now!
Taylor! Francis!
What is it...?
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
I, uh.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
We shall attack at once.
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
What? What do you mean you --
Now I can do what I want.
Now where are you going?
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Can we do that?
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
What?
What are you doing down there?
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
...lost the screw...
What about him?
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Where can I find him?
We're within range, sir.
You've been here from the start.
We've got him locked!
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Madmartigan.
Who is he?
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts  you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
What?
He says it's a bad idea!
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
Okay.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Right.
Unless you want the right.
No, you take the right.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
Okay.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
Good idea.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
I can't hold on much longer!
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
Yes sir I was.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Yes sir, I did.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
And what did they say about me?
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
We did the same thing last year also.
You got her warmed?
You can't be serious.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
There's always a surprise.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Big enough?
Stevie... I can't...
What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
Out.
When they coming in?
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
Not necessarily.
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
Now, get out!!
Yes, ma'am!
Stop that ma'am crap!
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
What's the delay?
About thirty seconds.
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
Yes.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
Correct.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You haven't heard me yet.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
What happened?
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
Just a thought.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
You don't even know these guys.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Here you go, baby.
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
Yeah.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Yes, I did.
Cynthia!
What!?
Why did you do that?
Because I wanted to.
But why did you want to?
I wanted him to see me.
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
He wouldn't do that.
You don't know that for sure.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
Did he touch you?
No, but I did.
Where are you?
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
I have a rough idea.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn write-off.
What's that?
When's Brian coming for the TV?
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
I was very original!
What the fuck is this guy doing?
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
Steady, now. We need your help.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
But Kirk...
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
Kirk. They're gone.
... Gone?!
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
Five minutes.
What?
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
Certainly not.
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
Your sex life?
What do you think?
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
Over the gold.
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
Fine.
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
What?
Will you think about it?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
Mrs. Haydn...
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
This isn't real?
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
Where's Joe?
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
I've got to talk to you...
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
What's wrong?
So you don't mind?
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
I think what you did was...
What?
I think what you did...
What?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Eddie.
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
Rio de Janeiro!
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
That's doable.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
Drink?
How old were you?
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
You are ready, then?
Okay...
...here comes the...
...tunnel!
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
Don't you have to be somewh...
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
Okay.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
Bathroom over there?
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Your toes cold?
How long has he been unconscious?
You do more than try.
You do.
Do you really think so, Andy?
Oh, that explains everything.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
That machine --
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
How long ago?
"Before I kill you."
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
I'll do it.
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
Shut up, all of you.
What are you looking to read?
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
I finished it.
Where are you taking her?
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
Nah, you go on.
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
Fuck you.
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
How's the chicken?
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
What is it?
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
Really?  You're the best.
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
Harder...
Rowan...
Harder...
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
Yessss...
That.
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
I'm out, Johnny.
If that's the way you want it.
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
Where?
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
Are you alright?
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
What did he say?
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
Speak up.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
Are you still in touch?
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
Which one?
Which one?
Which clinic?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
Well, here are fifty francs.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Bring me forty-five back.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
Good day...!
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Oh, no.
Are your parents alive?
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Don't say that.
So do we, lady.
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
What? On one hearing only?
You like Chicanos?
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
These are yours.
Four...
Jim...
When we backed you--
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
You've already met.
Where?
Right here. A minute ago.
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
We can't carry him.
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
I'm not gonna leave you!
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
You have Stromwell.
Did she do that to you, too?
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Neat.
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
I'm looking for somebody.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
We'll hear sirens soon.
Then we'll be safe?
Hello, Liz.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
I... I like you.  A lot.
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Yes...
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Thank you, Clarice.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
She sure does.
Look. Go on, look.
At what, exactly?
My van is half full.
So?
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
Dad, please.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
You're way ahead of me again?
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
The lesson being?
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
You're not real.
Can you stand something to eat?
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
I don't anymore.
Can I have some?
Before you go...
What?
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
Well, why not?
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Well. Old age flattens a man.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
You don't look alright.
Yeah... cop hit me...
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
Yeah.
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
Wait a minute...
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
What?
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
You could make their heads bleed, though.
What tied the room together, Dude?
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
What--
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
I was bowling--
I'm meeting someone.
What is it you want from me?
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
So we understand each other?
I can't even imagine.
This is neither the time nor the place --
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Kit
How goes it, Will?
Wonderful, wonderful.
Burbage says you have a play.
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
You're certain of that?
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
What happens when the baby comes?
Hi, George.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
Stomach again.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
For you, Mrs. Peel.
Say it.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
The driver will...
But I speak English.
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
I do not speak English.
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
You want this ticket?
Yes.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
How is it back there?
You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
So speaks the court jester.
Fuck you
I expected more from you.
Sorry to disappoint.
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Ted, the lever!
But this woman -- and her son --
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
It's not funny.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
Music?
Swell!
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
This isn't any better, Chris.
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
They didn't get my contracts.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
You goin' back inside?
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
One, up.
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
So where are you now?
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
Shit.
What is --
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
Yes, very.
And certainly pretty.
Yes.
How long have you known her?
I told you. We met yesterday.
In a bird shop.
Yes.
She was selling birds.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
Mother, where did you go to law school?
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
I know, Mother.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Yes, Mother.
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
I know, Mother.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Mother?
Yes?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
I bought him a watch too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
Yeah.
You could say that.
Zero's a number right?
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
What are you trying to pull?
I forgot she's in here.
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
Two o'clock.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
Yes Mother.
Why?
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
Your Majesty.
What do you love so much?
Your Majesty
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
When?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
That's right. When?
Would you like to come out tonight?
What time?
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
It's me sir.
Dwayne please calm down!
This shit was Ming.
Did you kill him?
I've been dreaming about this.
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
What's he doing there? Teaching?
No, he's working on another book.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
I didn't know that.
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
Yes.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
Look, Im sorry.  Im sorry I was such a saint before and Im such a prick now.  Maybe Im just not the same guy I was when we got married...
You too, preacher?
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
In the Winnebago.
I think so.
What's causing that!?
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Can you isolate the wave?
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
H-how do I get...?
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
No.  At dawn.
Why?
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
Here.
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
Go ahead.
No.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
I can't.
Why not?
I've told you.
But I don't understand --
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Yes.
Unbelievable.
Seven it is.
Your brother?
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
Well, hello.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
Was Mom an adjustment?
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
Like it were a piano?
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
You wanna do somethin' with me?
Not really.
Hey!
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
Well...uh...
Shame on you!
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
Strip?
Never should've let her play.
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
...honestly...
...you're money...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
Now go over there and get those digits.
You're money.
You fucking ass-holes.
What was that?
Nothing.
Someone's back there.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
Don't talk to me like that.
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
No.
"Liebestraum."
I just played it.
Play it again.
But that was the fourth straight time.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
"Liebestraum."
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
What sort have you got?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
Yeah.
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
Yes... Good, good...
So, what are you looking for?
What about an untrained pup, white...
How much of a hurry are you in?
Tomorrow?
Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
I see. How much?
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
... Fine. Ill go for the safe place.
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
Yes...
Where's Doug?
He's not coming.
Not coming? What happened?
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Sometime?
Yeah, like maybe never.
But what are you going to do?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Dartmouth?!
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
No...  It can't be.
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
I'm candy...
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
He's thirty-five years old.
You're a great architect, Albert.
Thank you.
I never said that!
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Who are you talking to?
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Of course not.
It would just be helpful to know.
No.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
I'm just preoccupied.
Do you like my new look?
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Really?
Sure. Of course.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
That's great.
Bernstein.
I think we should be going honey.
What for?
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
You're right. We should sit in silence.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
What are we like in...1998?
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
You really wanna know?
Yeah, you betcha.
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
She started shrieking, you know.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
The what?
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
The whale's mouth?
The Shark's mouth.
Things have been so serious here lately.
What's that tune that you're playing
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
Cattle ranch!
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
I'll only be a minute.
Once again please?
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
How old is Jeb?
Four.
Yeah, all in crates.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
Angelo!  Don't fire!
Kid, get outta the way!!
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
And she did it all for me.  For love.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
She wants to kill you.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
You can drive down there, Sir ..
Nothing.
Who might you be, little Miss?
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
This'll do.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Sort of.
I knew I should have driven.
Us. Lead us not into...
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Passion...
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
...Yes.
Without me.
Showdown.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Dick, we need some time apart --
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Dick...
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
No?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
What night?
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Who's it for? A relative?
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
Ten thousand sounds high.
Yes, Ed.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
Kristen, can you pull us out?
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
Poor fucker my ass...
What if every country legalized at the same time?
You think that?
You don't seem bothered.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Tell us about it.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
What?
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Like this place?
You're asking for somebody else?
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
Red flags man.
Not our problem.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
Not our problem.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
This guy's not a murderer.
Why do you think I ask?
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
He can't hear you!
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
So why are you talking to him?
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
It doesn't help him.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
Go away.
Don't you like me, Ben?
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
Oh, this is Betty.
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
You and I will guard the fire.
You killed them.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
So you killed them?
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I think I see it pretty well.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
I'm starving...somebody, help.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Yeah?
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Hello?
Kim-Lo?
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
What happened?
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
Tough day?
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
If that's what you call it.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
What do I do then?
Well did you like it?
You take care of Paulie?
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
Who's that?
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
He'll see right through it.
Well, uh...
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Small space?
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
Jesse, God - what happened?
... Hmmm... Elevator.
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
I am telling the truth.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
Oh, by the waywhat's your name?
Virgil?
God, I hate that bitch.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
I out rank you, that's why.
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
I'm sorry.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
You believe that?
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
Well, not me personally.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
Ten flights?
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
-- not yet --
-- it's just him? --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
No.
Bad time?
Kind of.
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
I very much doubt that he will.
Oh...?
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
What were you doing in my room?
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Your investment ideas never work out.
You look like dogshit.
James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it.
Thank you.
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit aa speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
...are followin' him around.
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
That's a big help. Where are you from?
From?
Are you from up there? Space?
Space?
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
Eight times.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
POP! That was My card!
But... I had a five...
October twenty-seventh.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
Peter.
What?
Why don't you like me?
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
<u>Why</u>?
I'm not sure.
But you suspect.
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Right now?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Yes ma'am.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
One shouldn't live alone.
Some people prefer it.
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
What's the code?
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Didn't I say that?
A little.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
No!...
You ever been in love?
Too many times.
They ever love you back?
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
Yeah.
Do you?
No.
You no gotta no gun.
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Popeye.
Yeah.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Mrs... Sutphin?
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
Thank God...
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
Stop that dog!
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
WHAT? WH
Because they're coming right at us.
Son, was Rose in your room last night?
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!
And she saved it.
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
Do you have any pictures if her?
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
What happened to you?
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
You need a doctor.
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
Yes, I understand.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
I didn't mean to hit you.
Following new course. Warp seven.
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
No.
Can I give you my testimony?
No!
Who was that on the phone?
Wrong number.
Why the empty cage?
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
Plenty of room for two people.
It'll just be me.
Student?
No.  You said three-fifty?
Plus first and last month deposit.
Will you lease month-to-month?
Not for three-fifty.
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
I've got that two o'clock in town.
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
...Huh?
What's it like?
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
Location.
...Guess what?
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
How senior?
Good day.
Good day.
Please, come in, so cold.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
I have helm control.
Yeah. No thanks.
Please. Why not?
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
I'm sorry.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
What? What's this?
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I met him in New York.
So tell me.  Where's Z?
I...I have no idea, sir.
How much money did you leave up there?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
You're trusting.
Why do you say that?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Ooh! Can we?!
Really?
I was kidding.
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Typically male point of view.
How do you figure?
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
"Be there?"
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
How flattering.
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
Oh, you think so?
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
And I actually date you?
Something wrong?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
I touched a nerve.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
How many?
How many what?
How many girls have you slept with?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
Including you?
It better be up to and including me.
Twelve.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
My hand.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Edie...
Get away from me.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
You sucked that guy's dick?
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
That's because I never had sex with him!
You sucked his dick!
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
Please calm down.
How many?
Dante...
How many dicks have you sucked?!
Let it go...
HOW MANY?
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
We're leaving.
You can't, your orders are specific...
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
Don't... don't do this...
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
Sire, I --
Where's home?
-- what're you talking about? --
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
Drink?
Hello, Beautiful.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
What does he say?
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. 
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Thank you, sir.
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's DaughterAlmost finished?
PAUL!
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.
And you don't want to keep him waiting.
Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
I'd be honored.
Only that?
And charmed, of course.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Do I not please you, Jack?
In every way.
And am I not fair?
Wondrously so.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
That was in jest.
Jest with me then.
How so?
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
And sweet?
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
He takes after our mother.
You think?
Is it me?
Maybe I should turn myself in.
Who's paging you?
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
You flew all the way h...
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
No Mark. MARK Why not?
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
Come on.
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
Is everyone here?
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
Good morning, sir.
Carter  bank examiner.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Yeah, very funny.
Picking up velocity.
Now hold him.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to watch him go.
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
It's only ten o'clock.
Jonah!
Okay.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
No, no.
So will you?
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
American literature. What else?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Not an easy book.
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
Why?
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
We wouldn't have met at all.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You've had dealings with the police before?
Who hasn't--one way or another?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
Is it a crime?
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
You were there when I last saw him.
Let's go.  Time to move out.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
Please...
It's been a while.
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
Perhaps.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
Is this Hell?
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
Good night.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Good.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
Good.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I think I'll read a little.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
Why do you say that?
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
I went for a walk.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
The Penny Saver sucks.
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
What's so special about him?
It's a bad idea.
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
Take it back, Freb --
And that's how I ended up here.
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
What's the word on the chairs?
I'm working on it.
What's the plan?
I can't.
Are you expecting anyone?
Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
I come for my lady Juliet.
Welcome.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
How do you do.
No signs of trouble?
What do ya mean?
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
They don't see it.
See what?
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
They aren't as watchful as you.
Too busy looking after themselves.
The greasy pole.
No loyalty.
It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
Let him trust Quintus.
Quintus is overly idealistic.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
Let's get the kids.
Maybe you don't even like children.
Of course I like children.
You've never even been around one.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Yeah.
Okay...  Night, baby.
George?
What!
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Okay, baby. Okay...
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
D'you find an apartment?
Still looking.
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Why?
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you?  A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Yes.  It was, actually.
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
Laura.
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
"Mitch?"
Mitch.
So I was replaced by Mitch?
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
Could I ask you a question?
Could I stop you?
You don't drink like you used to.
That's not a question.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Still not a question.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
You think too much?
We have a problem here?
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
Why?
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
Did Jenny know?
If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
They're following us.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
A satellite dish?
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
I thought you were watching him.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
So what happens now?
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
What about me?
What about you?
Do you think I took some of that money?
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
What's that?
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
You're going out?
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
Left you this place.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
That's a nice greenhouse.
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
The police station.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
You have no whiskey?
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
Let my kid go.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
As you say, Doctor.
There's what they're waiting on!
I can't, Andy.
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
What gives?
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Go where?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
What's wrong?
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Is that right?
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
Of what?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Two weeks, I guess.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
I never saw it before.
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...
What are movies about, Orson?
Forget it-
What are movies about?
Telling stories.
Nope.
Showing life
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
What kind of people?
He always knows.
The arrangement is over!
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Don't.  It's horrible.
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
Imagine that.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Might I ask why?
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
What do you propose?
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Did you hurt her?
White or black?
Mmm.
What!
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
No! At least I don't think I am!
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Sure. We can practice talking.
It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
It's Cochrane.
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Nah.  Maybe.
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
It's nothing personal, though. 
What's the matter?
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
Perrier water!
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
I don't want to move away.
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
But why can't we stay here?
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
No...
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
You can't talk to me like --
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
Check.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
Again?
Hello, Jimmy.
Dad.
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
Alexandretta. Now we know.
Yes. Now we know.
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
Write her.
You think so?
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah.  What's that?
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
Jah guides us.
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.
Your children?
This is our concern, Dude.
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
What happened?
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
Pull up to the entrance!
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
You make movies, huh?
You killed him you fucking faggot --
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
But Rennie...
This girl is a friend of yours?
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
I thought you were married!
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
This girl has a child?
We have a daughter.
Dewey?
Hi, private eye guy!
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
Jack, I --
HARRY, can you hear me?
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
What?
I don't believe it.
What's the matter?
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Yeah ... How'd you know?
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
I thank you.
Here's a real present.
What... huh?
Check it out.
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
You said that the last time.
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
We could, if I'm not in jail.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Neither.
He didn't.
Oh, he did.
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Oh no, I couldn't.
Untie that rope.
Betty, Betty, Betty...
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Like... us?
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
Huh?
I can read it to you.
You mean, again?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Oh. What happens now?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
What's this about?
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
What's your first move?
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
The Stratford.
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Huh?
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
I beg your pardon.
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
Why not?
I saw one.
You saw a MiG 21?
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Where did you see that?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
That's right.
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Just what is your question?
What color were the original Hebrews?
I told you we don't know for certain.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
In case of what?
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
It's a woman shot in a car?
Yes.  I have to go...
Only one car.
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Good.
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
At your service, Count.
It's not them...it's it...
What?
Yeah.
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
And we're going away for a holiday.
For a month.
A month.
Right and don't embellish.
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
No, I'm good.
Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it drunker or drunker-er?
Great.
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
Sure.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
Sounds great, Swanney.
Yeah.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
Not for me ..
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
And we're very grateful.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
An offense --
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
True enough.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Morning Mr. North
Same.
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
No.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
I'm sending you the files.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
Excuse me.
What's wrong.
You don't love me.
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Don't feel bad.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
Oh--a hundred times--
--and I can tell you where to get off.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Will you leave me alone?
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
Baloney!
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
Why not?
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
I'm a professional killer.
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
When does the bus leave?
In about fifteen minutes.
Who wants fruit salad?
I do, please.
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
It's sugarless.
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
So why'd you give up ball?
Why do you keep asking me that?
Cause I don't get it.
Something was just missing.
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
Impressive
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
What's the story?
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
No.
Where do you stand on all this?
On all what?
On Furtwngler.
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
Oh yeah...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
Not really...
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
Do the books!  Do the books!
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
Thanks very much.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Hundreds of times.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
No.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
I suspected that he -- well.
What?
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
Everything's gonna be fine.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
Go live in a tent.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
What's the matter, Grampa?
I can take care of myself.
What?
 
What?
It's working.



We got-...
...-ta get outta here!
 Vitelli! Vitelli!

Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
No . . . No . . . No. . .
The new place? New.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
Oh!
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Rosalie, you okay?
Four!
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Doc...
...Long.
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...time to time, yeah.
Not tonight...
...though.

Odd, then, that his car...
...should be right outside.
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
Where?  What?
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
But that's cheating!
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
That her?
Yeah.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
Thank you VERY much indeed.
Now stop it!
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
What room?
Whatcha doin'?
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
What do you mean?
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
What did Tommy say?
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
Got a cigarette?
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
You have beautiful eyes.
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
Jim was old enough...
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Yeah.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
What about chicken?
That's meat.
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Steve...
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
Wendigo?
Of course it is.
Good night, David.
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
The DMZ?
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
What hours do you work?
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
You must be rich.
It keeps ya busy.
You know what you remind me of?
What?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Oh. Who was that again?
The singer?
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
Clever girl.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
What was the bullet?
Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
Sean --
What?
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
I'm in a car wash.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
Would you care to go topside?
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
Miss Boatwright --
Yes, David...
Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...? Hel...?  I'm going to need an <u>ambulance</u>, we take him, the last moment, right from the Pl...no, <u>we</u> land, we puttem <u>in</u> the ambulance.  Air force jet lands, we take somebody <u>else</u> off <u>that</u> jet...what the fuck do <u>I</u> care? Somebody in a Hospital gown.  And we need a ......hello?  Hello...?
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
An anti-psychotic...
You know where it is?
How is she?
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
Go away.
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Shut up.
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
Nick...
I beg your pardon?
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
One more round.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
...Stop jivin'!
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
She's fucking hot!
No.
I've been wondering something.
Again?
Do you have any friends, man?
No.  We can't risk it.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
I can't...
You have to! Quickly!
We gotta get to Hector!!
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
How many of you are there?
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
What happens then?
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
LaMagra --
Mick. Mick. Mick...
What?
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
Making a living.
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
Who knows? Fog, night...
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Waiter! Check, please!
She finds him "personable."
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
No wonder he was angry.
Next time, call...
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
And our forces?
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
That's it?
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
Oh, man! Who told?
What are you doing?
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
I have to go, Julian.
Why? Why do you have to go?
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
It's your best play, Nicky.
They'll lose because they're my team.
Humiliations galore!
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Where?
Just around the corner.
How will I know you?
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
What about back home?
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
Shit!
I have a place for that.
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
Hi.
Rose, pass the wine.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
You've killed women?
Stop that.
It's not going to help us!
You had a date with Carlton?
Brad, please lets get out of here.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Well I want to leave.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
And?
And I--we--want some Black people up.
Did you ask Sal?
She's alive!! She is not dead?
You were in insurance before the war.
Right. Claims assessor.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
They said I was dogged?
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Like this bandleader.
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
Then -
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
Oh, sorry, right.
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
Listen to what?
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
Where is she?
All your soldiers speak Latin?
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
Will you at least let me stay with you?
I've got to go.
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
Negative.
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
What about?
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
Why don't you see Lester?
Your husband?
Yes.
What about?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
You're not finished here?
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
. . . That was quick.
You had me worried to death!
But Sean said...
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
And the rest of 'em?
This is why you don't show work in progress.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I can't imagine any place better than here.
Howard --
The blonde dish.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
Harrington.
Sure. I met you.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
Of course.  Of course.
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
Not now, Wendy.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
I'm really rooting for this one.
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
You sure you know where to find one?
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
And what does that mean?
I SHIT on all o' you.
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
What about the phosphorous grenade?
George, you know I only love you, but...
But not more than your comfort.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
That's a lie!
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
I don't know.  Fly casual.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
That'll keep you busy.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
Good one.
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
Did you watch it yet?
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
Oh, Betty --
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
No... what about your sister?
Elaine.
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
The present situation?
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
You know about the United Nations?
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
He's not, he's...
That son of a bitch.
You know who this is?
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
Sure.
Do you like pink?
Very much.
Where do you hail from?
Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
Who?
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Report!
We've lost Bridge control!
Emergency override!
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
I was just scared is all.
I hope you find the figures correct.
I hope so, too.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
Fine.  That's great.
Is that it?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Nice friend.
Yeah.
What's his name?
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
No, Bud, no... not you.
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
Yeah, how so?
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
There's always a bright side.
I'm listening, sir.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
I ran into complications.
I hate to say it...
Then don't.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
We're gone.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Uncle, how are you feeling?
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
You send telegrams here?
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is"  No, do you really?
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof"
Mush. Mush.
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
Send it collect.
Collect?
See? We're not so bad.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
I need to get this letter to someone.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
No, it hasn't.
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
But Countess...
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
Yes.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Yes.
Are your parents living?
Why, no.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
That is what bothers me.
What is it, dad?
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
Sugar or honey?
You want I set up?
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Muchas gracias.
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
No.
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Let her know what?
Who was that?
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Bingo.
You found her.
Better. I found Ryuji.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka.
Osaka?
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
What's going on?
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
That's right...
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
That's the truth...
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
Huh.
You don't ax your sales force.
No.
You...
You...
You build it!
That's what I...
You fucking build it!  Men come...
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
You nervous...?
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
We're working.
It's a party.
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
Hi. How are you feeling?
I was dreaming.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.
But it was just mine.
I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
What happened?
What difference does it make...?
Give me your coat.
Let it ride for a while.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
That was the general idea.
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
How did you know?!
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
1899.
I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
What are you?
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
Why does he do it?
I'm putting it here by the door.
Will you bring it in to me?
I'd rather not.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
Taken.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
These are hard times, Tom.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
Yeah, but, buddy --
He's not going to do it.
What else have you got?
Where's Lenny?
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
Cow tipping?
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
I'll take care of it.
How about calling it a night?
What?
Thanks.  You, too.
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
What!
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
No, I'm not.
Girlfriend?
No.
Gay?
Do I have a choice in this?
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
How many weeks?
Just one.
Who was that?
That was Beaumont.
Who was Beaumont?
An employee I had to let go.
What did he do?
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah.
So we on the same page then?
So... how'd you hear about this?
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Oh, Maya. No.
You want ME to go up there?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
See, ya.
Why doesn't it never work out?
What?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
What does it say?
It's gone to the top.
How high is that?
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
The what?
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
Did you really ask?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Want to dance?
Dance? Here?
Why not?
They know you here--know your name.
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
I'm married.
You bit my finger.
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
Oh --
At last I find you.
Miss, would I be prying?
Everything is wrong.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
No.
Are you in trouble with the law?
No.
You're back, boychick.
Sid, how are they hanging?
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
It's not your fault, Dad.
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
...and buried him.
Morning, Coogan.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
You--  Standards and Practices?
Ed Smythe, yes.
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
Don't you move!!!
Sorry.  We were saying?
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Forgive me if I have offended you.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
SLIP-STREAM.
What?
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Donnie?
Yeah?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Why?
What the hell do you know?
Hey!
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
How much time?
Time.
What time is it now?
Twenty-after-ten.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
She hasn't actually done anything...
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
I ain't no preacher anymore.
There's something wrong with this picture.
What picture?
I'm talking about you.
Me?
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
oh dear.
What happened?!!!
Where's yours?
Over there man.
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
Movies?
What's the matter?
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
Well, sit down.
Oh, Jesus.
You all right?
I don't know, I mean, I-
You wanna lie down?
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
How about a ginger ale?
Catch you back at the wall.
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
Jesus Christ.
It's alright.  He means it.
You've been up all night?
That obvious, huh?
Then you saw him, too?
You're loosing your cool
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
You called the doctor, huh?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Why would they care?
You have had girlfriends?
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh - I'll get it!
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
I know. That's why I went.
But then you told her you were home.
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Well, maybe you missed something?
They let you out?
See something?
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
The letter I sent.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
You walk past me?
Hey. This is Shelly.
Where did you find it by the way?
I had it all on tape...
What did you do then?
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
What happened with the tape?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
Will?
Shit!
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
It must be one of these...
Yeah, sure... very funny....
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
I - I'd really rather not...
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
I don't think so...
PLEASE? We have to!
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
Is that good or bad?
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
They'll be back in a week.
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
I don't like no witnesses.
We won't breathe a word.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
I'm not FBI anymore.
You never were...
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
One more?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
Are you?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
How'd you find that out?
He told me last night.
He called you?
He came by.
What?... What'd you do?
It's time for you to leave.
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
You think so, Frankie?
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
Got to think this through ...
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Violet, please!
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Why the south latrine?
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
Bullshit.
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
Well... sure...
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Barton!
I want to know!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Hah!
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
...How's the paintin' goin'?
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're real good.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
A long time.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Nothin' much.
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
I need to see you, Jake.
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
You're not tired of it?
Hi.
Hello.
I'm Opal.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
My God, what happened here?
You feign ignorance?
WHAT HAPPENED?
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
Talk!  Say something!
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
I understand that, sir.
No, sir!
What's left over?'
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
Come on, you guys.
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
You've nothing to apologize for.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
Now what -- ?
Hey, Findley's here.
Where?
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
Close the door.
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
You give me a pain!
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
And they never proved anything against him.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
Stop it! Just cut it out!
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
How do you know?
Mrs. Peel?
What kept you?
You had the number.
Julie! Wait! You okay?
I'm fine.
You sure?
I'm fine.
That's where he'll be.
What?
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
A bad insurance risk?
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
A cemetery?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
D'Amour --
Shit...
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
This way, Mister McMurphy.
I never touched her.
Those mountains? are they?
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
Uh huh, pleasure.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
That was my first question.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
Yes -- that is true.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
Would you care to be more specific?
Where's Shorty?
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
You're hot!
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
What are they doing?
I could have it sent out...
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
Michael...
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
You're not my father!
Then why do you come to me?
Because I need MONEY!
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
Do you have it?
Not so fast.  Who's that?
He's company.
Bad company...
What do you mean?
I was right! Step on it!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Casharoonie!
Dad...
Oh...
You worked out well.
It isn't Kathy.
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
Leland, what are you doing?
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
I'll help ya.
I know...it sounds insane.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
Command me, lord.
Spare a chair?
Kahn?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
Oh my God, he's back.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Shut up.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
What's that?
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
Kirsty? It's very late.
Where's Daddy?
What's the problem?
I have to see my father.
What happened?
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
Flat, wraparound headlights?
Yeah.
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
As opposed to?
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Yes.
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
Guy's a spook!
Yeah, but for who?							*
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
Saddle River, New York!
It's in New Jersey.
New York.
I think it's in New Jersey.
It's in New York.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
You really came back for more?  Of this?
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
Does Bella come here?
That's where we're all going.
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
I think I had some when I was eight.
Did you like it?
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
Go on. Tell me more about her.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
I'll make the soap myself.
But the rest is right.
Will she be dark or fair?
I don't think you understand.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
Why it's just a snip of calico...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
Would you like a cigarette?
Kay--
I'm sorry, Bill --
That's okay.
What's okay?
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
-- We must do something...
Yes, the police must be called.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
Yes, I know them --
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
Er. well, nowhere special.
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
So what do we do?
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
Where is this happening?
Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
Yup.
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
We don't hang them at home, y'know  just in the streets..
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Who said that?
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
Where are you going?
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
Okay.
Get this thing out of me!
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
I'm happy for you, pal.
Thanks, buddy.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
We can take your car.
What was that?
It's freezing.
I'm not cold.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
It's not healthy with it closed.
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Go where, Ray?
Back to New York for starters.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Don't make me take them away from you.
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
That's what Josh and Mike said.
What's happening?
It's starting to let go!
What about the suicide?
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
By what name are you known?
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Greetings King Arthur.
You know my name?
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
And those are Luke's and mine.
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Am I too heavy for you?
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
Well why didn't you say so?
Geez.
What the hell are you doing?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
I am Gale Weathers!
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
None.
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
What'll it be, Auggie?
Where's it gone?
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
Would you desert your friends?
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Whoa. Calm down.
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Take it easy!
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
You have rope?
I am too old to climb down a rope.
What is it?
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
I don't believe you.
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
Heading three-three-four...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
What the --!
Ben.  Are you okay?
Borgus Frat.
"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
You're hung up again.
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Sit down? What are . . .
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Well, naturally. Of course.
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
Armed.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Thanks.
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
I don't want it now.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
What happened?
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
Local?
You can have both if you want.
I have a map.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
The Building and what?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
*                     Please tell me your name.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
"All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
"Madam!"
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
"Madam!"
That was good.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Three-one-zero, aye!
I will follow you.
What's he in for?
Feeling all right?
No onions though, okay?
No onions?
What?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
No thank you.
Are you sure?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
Sir, yes, sir!
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
Dad!
What?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
You think I'm fake.
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
You disrespect our tradition.
Your Majesty...
Where's your brother?
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
Symington says...
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating.
Yes.
What would you call it?
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
U-huh.
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
Piggyback ride.
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  Id have found it in a minute.
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
Okay.
I must go.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Let's forget that we ever met.
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
As a representative of Moscow...
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
You know I want to...
Then do it through my lawyer!
I paid for it.
I think we're ready now, thank you.  And how was Norfolk?  Did you get on with my mother?
I think she liked me.
Did she talk about me?
Were you scared up there?
You bet.
You don't act like it?
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
I know it well.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
They do not have your connections.
Why, yes. This is amazing.
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
You think we need a new jail?
You're around every afternoon?
Knock knock.
Who's there?
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
What?
It's a surprise.
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
You got the Extender?
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
Yes ma'am.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
I miss her.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
Ya think?
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
Fine. But what would I do at night?
Be here. In case.
In case of what?
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
Satisfied?
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
I don't know what you mean.
I still don't see you.
I can't let you do that.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
It's the bitterest of pills.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
You can't come in.  They don't want --
Gaiijin.
What the hell is going on?!!?
Stop it.
What the hell happened to you?
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Your hair's different.
Everything's different.
Are you drunk?
No. Are you drunk?
No. But I have a hangover.
Where's pop?
I said, I come to town with a girl.
Plannin' on getting married?
No.
'Don't sound so sure.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
And what? These things are octopusses?
How are the others?
The others, sir?
Beth and Harry?
I'm not going!
You don't have a choice.
Go away.
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
Thanks. 
What time did you get to bed last night?
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
You work too hard, you know that?
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Come on, just a little hint.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
The inspiration.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
No way.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
The end.
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
It wasn't like that.
Good.
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
NedI knowI know
It's good.
Oh
The title won't do.
Ah
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
You will go alone.
I won't leave you here.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
What's wrong?
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes.
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
Any movie stars buried here?
Probably.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
I don't think the dead much care.
Are you sure?
They couldn't do anything for me.
How 'bout the morgue?
Little high.
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
What about you, you got a crew already?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Okay. 
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Yeah --
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
You got that big retarded girl down there?
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
What the hell....
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Stay here.
Why can't I go out there with you?
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Just wait here?
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
No...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
I don't take orders at all.
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
I used it to start the fire --
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
How can you say that to me?
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Not these guys.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
But then how can you...
Shit.
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
Who told you that?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
What's all the noise in here!
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
We only live a few blocks apart.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
I don't believe it!
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
You ever see her talk to the walls?
No, but--
You live in such a fantasy world...
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Hello?
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
When do we get to the lighthouse?
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Where are my children?
What...virus?
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
What the hell are you talking about --
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
What are you talking about?
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
Dad died from a heart attack....
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
Head for... for the white water.
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
What?
What's your name, sailor ?
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
Which couch?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
What the hell are you doing?
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Of course not.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Really?
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Yes?
Hey.
How's it going?
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
Where's Mac?
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
Uh huh.
What's wrong?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
What?!
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
What are you and Mike going to do?
I'm alone on this...
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Well I guess...
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
He's fine.
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Okay.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
You the architect?
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
"Arkady"
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
The old lady?
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
Don't start, Farmer.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
What else do you know?
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
But -
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Wake up, man, wake up!
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
See if mine are in there.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
Look at the treads on those.
What about them?
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
You're really gonna pop the question?
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
CRIMINAL
Who...who kills me?
Sixteen years ago.
Whatta you mean?
Mean?
Shit!
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
Keep the change.
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
You rest now.
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
What?
Will you take me home?
What?
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Always a mood killer.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
That man that shot you died in prison.
In Angola. Yeah.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
You okay?
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
What?
Is the line sinking?
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
You got a better idea?
Hi.
Hi.
You really want to do this, don't you?
Where did you get that?
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
You think she really likes him?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
You know what would be great?
What?
The prices are going up.
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
What?
Did they live?
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
That does sound lucky.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Oh my God...!
What happened?
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
Tell him we gotta go.
What are they?
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
No screamin' shit.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Who?
Thanks for sharing.
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
If you do anything to my friend...
Where -- where do we go now?
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
I guess not.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
You say that like I don't know that.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
And when did that pass?
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
You come and visit.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
Stu was with me last night.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
Working, thank you.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
Steam.
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
The Queen of England?
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
That's not a satisfactory answer.
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
Nick, what happened --
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Let's walk through the park...
No... let's walk through the city.
Or her, or her - or any of them?
Claudia, you torture yourself.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
My pocketbook.
What's in it?
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
Poppy, please --
If you loved me like I loved you?
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I think it's just over there.
Is that what I think it is?
No, it's a treasure map.
Cool.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
What?
Great.
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
What's that smell!?
Ground defense.
I'm all wet.
Hi mom.
Did you kill Yankees?
A fair number, Ma.
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
Im having kind of a bad day.
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
No?
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Excuse me?
Gimme the ball!
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
I don't think it was them.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
I don't know yet.
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
Anyone at home?
I live there. Alone.
Someone is sitting in that window.
Tie up Clark, too.
He's dead.
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
What was your name again?
Michelle.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Yes.  Seriously.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Whatever you want.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
The 6 horse is last.
That's okay. That's his style.
To run last?
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
Who are you?
What?
Megan Halesy' little sister.
A fulcrum release lever!
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
Look.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
Giovanni.
Huh?
What's wrong?
Your eye.
What about it?
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
...A flaw...
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
What?
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Albatross?
Yeah.
Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
Gieg, Chuck.
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
Come aboard.
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
For what?
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
What?
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
I'm serious.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
I don't know they just always need it.
What, am I radioactive or something?
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
From her point of view or mine?
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Right.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesnt work like that and I cant tell you why.
Why not?
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Nothing really worthwhile.
Where you going?
Alone at last.
Now where were we?
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
Don't you hurt her!
He's not in this building.
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
Mac... let's get out of here.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
Bobby?
Wait a minute - let me out.
Well, there's not much time.
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
This way?
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
They'd frame him.
He's out of prison?
Do you mean that?
Old woman!
Man!
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
I'm thirty-seven.
Ice cream!
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Smart girl.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
Thank you, Colonel.
Captain.
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
I'm going to find out.
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
But what about this?
I know.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
You are.
Thank you, Thomas.
You're not looking too good.
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
What's this guy's problem?
I thought we were on our way.
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Taking a shower.
Hi.
Come on in!
That's okay.
It's just a corpse.
I know that.
Dad, you there?  You okay?
Yes, sir.
Do you understand me?
No, sir.
Did you see the papers today?
Yes, sir, I did.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
I'm getting a trajectory...
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
Are you offering me a bribe?
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
What'd you tell your father?
What's really on your wicked little mind?
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
That's a reasonable possibility.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
What's your point?
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
You're the man with the gun.
Naturally.
Naturally.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
Reba...
Francis? Where are you?
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
No. Reba...?
Are you okay...?
I'll see you later. All right?
You'll come by?
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
And roosters.
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
No, sir --
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
Who?
Darling!
Hello...?
Surprised?
Well... yes.
Miss me?
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
What's the point?  Look at me.
What's wrong with your hand?
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Yes, Reverend?
What do you want with those two medical officers?
Good evening.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Can you afford this place?
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
You tell on me, I tell on you.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
He came in four minutes ago.
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
Like heroin?
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Like love?
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
But what -- 
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
Yeah, I read those.
What did you think?
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
I did.
That must have taken you a long time.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
Gabe are you alright?
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
What?
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
Is this in any way unclear?
What do I tell your mother?
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
I'd better get back now.
You can put it anywhere.
Even there?
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
Adenoids?
Australia.
What?
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Really?
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
What have they got that we ain't got?
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
Me, too.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
It's Stanley, sir.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
What was it called, sir.
Boogerland!
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
I'll be watching over you.
Come down here, you scamp.
Who is she?
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
Is your dad here?
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
No.
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
It is.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
Yeah.
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Or flowers.
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Would you want to work with us on this?
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
No thanks.
... Then you really are a gardener?
Yes.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
You think the extra strain caused it?
I'm Melanie.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
Are you a good lawyer?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
What do you love about it?
Hello, Jack!
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
Why not?
It's humiliating.
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
I have not read you your rights.
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
I hereby acknowledge that...
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!
It's John, isn't it?
It's always John.
Still wants to move out?
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
This kid just wants his freedom.
It's not going to happen.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
That's good.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
Yes, you said.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
No, thanks Dad.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
Yes, something.
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
You mean with the flowers...?
What's it say?
How long have you been here?
Maybe ten minutes...  Thats strange.
Joe...  Joe...
Is that an offer?
What's  the matter now?
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
No.
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
Looks good.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
Why did you leave?
They left. I had to go with them.
Cut it back a little bit.
No fucking way.
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
I wanna live at the beach someday.
Northeast sir!
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
There's still good in him.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
I can't do it, Ben.
You cannot escape your destiny.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
What's that?
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
Sounds like heavy artillery...
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
Just do it quickly.
He does this every year?
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
Admit it. We're lost.
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
I figured that out.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
Where did you get those?
I've been doing my homework.
Just like old times?
Better than old times.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Where did you get them developed?
Assumed name... Houston.
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Why not?
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
Die, you pond scum!
And Jinnah?
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
Will you kill me?
Use the fucking bomb!
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
What?
And then you'll leave her out of it?
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
No!
I'll bring it back.
Erik. You don't understand.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
But you don't realize....
What's in here then, lead?
It's my mother's piano.
Well, I don't get it.
Huh? Get what?
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Well?
Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Where's that?
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Dorothy!  Is she here?
Why would anyone do this?
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
Yes, your honor.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
This is nicer than your other apartment.
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
Sir, you did it.
Go die, asshole!
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
And Jonas?
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
Where do you think Jerry is?
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
What do you suggest?
That you come with me.
Need something else?
No, I was just... How you doing?
Great. Good. Content...
Oh. How come?
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
They're fine... you miss it?
You must be joking.
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
You're sure it's okay?
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
He's already angry, I don't think --
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
You sat and talked until it was light...
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
...So give me the fuckin part...
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
Yes.
What does <u>that</u> mean?
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
...would you use a small word?
For approval.
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
Yes.
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
What?
Wait. Don't.
I don't like things that make you cry.
With... with Annie, of course.
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
I'm sure.
Seven o'clock then.
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
It's cold, Daddy!
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
Now?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
...along.
Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
I love that.  That's my type.
Kip - come and dance with me
I'm going to be a policeman.
What's your name?
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
That's necessary, huh?
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
Can you - ?
Listen...
All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
No.
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
You a pervert?
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
What for?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Doubt it.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Whoopee.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She told me.
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
What?
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
We did our best, Comrade.
What happened?
There.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
And I miss you.
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Yeah?
You mean they buy it?
What do you want me to do?
Find out who this Renquist it.
How?
Gus, have you ever been in love?
Leave.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
That was uncalled-for.
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
They'll soon be over.
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Have a good trip.
Where do you think you're going?
Back in.
You fucking nuts?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
You got that right.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
I got a problem...
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
Don't you fucking knock?
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
Paul, get out!
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
What do you want with us?
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
They're just leftovers.
Is it chicken?
How's your stomach?
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
I can't help the traffic.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
It will be okay.
*What* will be okay?
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
He's crazy.
No, he's not. You are.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
You got the will in there, don't ya?
No, I don't.
You tricked me, damn you!
Take it easy.
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
I never said it was!
Oh, how beautiful!
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
I shall wear it in my hair!
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--
I won't be here Sunday.
--we need more charcoal.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
Now, that's American music.
Yes, I know this song.
You know War?
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
What about the sheriff's task force?
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Pontificated.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
Scottie --
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
You're right. Only you can do that.
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
I didn't know that.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
We're from...
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
They wanna talk to you.
About what?
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
They do.
Really...
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Definitely old.
How do you know that?
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
I don't know what you mean.
The hell you don't.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
It wasn't like that.
No?
No.
What was it like?
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
Scumbag. What are you doing?
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
He's your cousin?
Check this out, he's from Russia.
No way.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
Well...
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
Really? That's remarkable.
The same windows.
And I love you too.
Don't get yourself all worked up--
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
Yes?
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
What?
Your memory.
What about it?
It may have been affected.
Oh.
You may not remember things.
What things?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Oh...that's okay.
When you do...
Do what?
When you remember...
Remember what?
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Right.
Who...are you?
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
How do I look?
Fine. You look fine.
Thanks.
Well...
Well what?
We're here.
Here?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Oh.
Don't you want to get out?
Oh....Sure.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
I feel fine.
You'll feel better
I will?
What "what"?
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
Maybe it would do us both good.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
Yeah.
To shave your chest?
Anything?
What was his name?
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
How much time do you have left on it?
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
A woman?
Hey drop it, okay?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
And that was the end of it?
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
Then the devil is white.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I sure met some.
What's in the box?
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
Mathesar? What is that?
What?!
Minneapolis.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
Look at these. What are these?
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
Well, if that's the way you f...
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Saw who?!
Matt?
Muh??
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
What about one forty-two.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
No, one forty-two.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
And mine's Conway.
How do you do?
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
Walter--
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
Yeah.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
No.
What you got in mind?
I want to meet Ratan.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
You're talking about real excitement?
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
Who told you about this?
Rucker.
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Well...
Take it or leave it.
Okay.
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
Youre wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought hed wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I dont know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didnt know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.
You dont say.
Huh?
You want this in black chips.
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Is that so!
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
I haven't gotten it yet.
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
...you, Mason?
Apparently, your sister died.
Jenny?
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
What happened?
Young woman cut herself.
Shall I call the doctor?
I didn't sell -
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
What did they do with you?
They booted me out of Washington.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
Not in front of the kid.
Must be a compartment.
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
You'll just have to have faith.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
Dennis!
Get your links set up!
I wanna patch in from...
...here!
What about these two?
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
You had enough?
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
Sick?  How sick?
The flu.
So she's got a few sniffles.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Yours...?!
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
21.
No problem with me on the Job.
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Yeah.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
I have felt it.
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
Our destruction?  Who?
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
Good party.
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
Who's the song bird?
Nick Charles here?
Yes.  Nick!
You his wife?
Yes.
I just charged $12.95 to our room for that movie. Now I'll never know how the story ends.
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
I don't know about that.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
What, I don't know how you mean?
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
Hello?
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Can't.
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Which one was that?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Oh, yeah.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
What makes you say that?
I could see she likes you.
Yeah, sure.
I'll call her up.
We're supposed to be asleep.
Don't talk like that!
Lowell.
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
Lowell.
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
Lowell!
What?
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
And what if I say no?
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you - you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister  whom I had lost and have found again....   
I know  I shouldn't have told you
Sit down.
You mean Gandhi?
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
What was he like?
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
Take me away...
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
No!
That bothers you?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
People aren't that simple.
This the right place?
You're somewhere else, where?
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Uh-huh. And?
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
Did you?
No.
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
It's still sick.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
I've lost my car.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
You want I nut him in the boat?
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
You want me to let him in?
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
For five hundred, what do I get?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
For two hundred?
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
You mentioned information.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
A thousand.
Got it on you?
Got the information on you?
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
What's it to you?
Come on. How much?
'Bout five thousand.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
You serious?
Sure am.
And I keep my mouth shut?
That's what I want.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
You got it.
I don't want any trouble.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
I don't care.
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
Books. He's my biographer.
Indeterminate life signs.
Fine by me, sir!
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
I can't help it.
He's nothing like you.
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
We can't wait to be sure.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
-- where's left to go? --
Glass, what is it?
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
What's MOW?
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
Really? Well, let it rip.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
-- the sadistic prick --
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Probably not. no. Why?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
Then go ahead go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
'Bye, Mom.
I can't find my ball.
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
Mornin'.
Is this your establishment?
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
....-lene.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
Iced coffee.
I assume you want that to go.
Assumptions are always...
...dangerous.
Quite a getup for jacking...
...deer.
I beg your pardon?
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
I assume you have one.
It's okay sweetheart.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
I will I promise.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
Just like that?
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
How's that been?
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
Kind of isolated.
Another fifteen seconds to go.
What time is it?
Later. Go back to sleep.
Where you going?
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Now?!  It's after eleven.
I can't sleep.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
How do I know?
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
No, I don't know.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
Thanks, doll.
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
Can I ask you a question?
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
Heaven?
How much?
What do you mean by that?
Just what you think I mean.
Are you threatening me?
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
Sir?
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
I took the early rounds.
I'll bet.
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
You mock my pain!
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
You know each other?
We've met.
What?!
Well?  Aren't you?
Well. . . yeah.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
Sonny kicks ass.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Is that your real name? Really?
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
That's not it.
Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
All right.
Fuck. Me.
Call me please, Patrick.
Hello--
You ready?
I will be in just a minute.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
Excuse me, Skipper---
Yes, Griff?
You too, sweetheart...
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Then what is he doing?
Careful of that edging there...
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
My fault.
You're not hurt, are you?
I don't think so.
I wish you'd make sure.
Why?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Of course.
Go inside. I'll be right there.
What are you gonna do?
They are living creatures out there.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Where's this "reactor" come from?
Aliens built it.
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
Congratulations, sir.
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
You don't?
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
Is that clear?
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
Queen of diamonds.
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
And that was 28 days ago today.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
What kind of animal?
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
It was Freddy.
Enough of that crap.
So I been told.
It's for your own good.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
Who's controlling your mind?
I assume this is on Rex?
You have something, Dr. Weir?
The date.
What about it?
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
It's 2041...
Shit.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
Let her go.
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Flies the plane....
You're shaking. What is it?
Tension. It'll go.
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
What is it?
Hey.
Hey. Nice tie.
Chief - mind if I take her?
How long has -
Agent Novak?
Peter, okay?
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Hi, Mom. 
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
You've got a midnight matinee.
Now, look here, Norm ...
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
What?
Oh, no.
Who is it?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
You learned her lessons better than I.
No, we couldn't!
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
Your Majesty!
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
Where are you, Walker?
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
What did he ever do to you?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
Adele for god sake please lis...
I'd kill ya.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
Don't try me.
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
No way.
Only one guys checked in?
Yeah.
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
No?
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
I know that...
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
I could come with you.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
You're gross.  See that guy?
Which one?
He gives me a total boner!
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
How so?
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
Yes?
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
I'll be with you.
I don't want to go tonight.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
Uh, huh.
What?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
It was too dark, Daddy.
I ain't full.
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
It must be the altitude  you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys --
The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night 
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
Dad -- can you listen --
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
What did Gino drink?
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
I can't go nowhere.
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
Who's the pilot?
Maybe we should back off a bit.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
You know what I love about all this?
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
You hassling my driver again?
Who is this?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
See you in hell, Snake.
Known me for long?
What's going on?
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
Oh. I see.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
She's perfectly safe.
What about money?
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
I thought you weren't talking to me.
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
I had him in my grasp.
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
Yeah?
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
She's nice.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
When are you leaving?
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Yeah.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
What do you mean?
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Something shouldn't be there.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Kind of liked you as a girl.
That's a start.
So I'm sorry.
Make it up to me, then.
How?
Ask to meet me again.
Will you meet me again?
When?
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
Where the hell could they have gone!
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
Go to lunch, will you...
I want to work today, that's why I came...
The leads come in, I'll let...
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Just go to lunch.
I don't want to go to lunch.
Go to lunch, George.
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
I want... to marry you!
I... accept your proposal!
I'm not just saying it!
Nor I!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
You scare me.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Rose, get in the boat!
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
Who do you see?
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
It was a veal stock, I thi...
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
I could be her.
It sounds impossible --
You said --
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
Who's phone?
What is this interest you've got in her?
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
I thought you hardly know her.
You're the Sphinx.
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
What do we do?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
What the hell does that mean?
What are you doing?
Let it be broke.
Can ya dig it?
It's dug.
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
What it is -- is the truth.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
No Dude.
You must shut down the engines.
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
Its a glimpse, Jacko.
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of em take a couple seconds...  ...some of em take a lot longer...
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
Get up.
What?
You're fired. I have new representation.
Turn up this road.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
I read your book.
Really.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
What'd you think?
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
I don't follow.
We're not going to make the storage room!
I gotta get back to work.
Where's Wong?
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
What a surprise...
Want one?
I don't drink beer.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
No, I won't let you do it.
Alex, what are you doing?
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
How is your cold?
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
So I see.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
How come?
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
Oh.
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
Yes...what is it?
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
... What??
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
So, what did they say?
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
Sure is pretty.
What'd you come out here for?
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
What'd she say?
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
What is it, now?  Tell me...
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
I don't know what you're talking about?
I think you know.
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
How old are you?
Thank you.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Okay.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
What are you doing?
Where'd he ever see us?
D.C.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
It's my fault.
What --
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
Tell me -- let me help --
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
I don't need you to "stick."
You want...
I don't know --
Well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. Can you walk or not?
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
What do you think?
What do you mean?
The room!
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
What happened to you?
I don't think you should...
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
And where exactly does that put your position...?
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
Is something funny?
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
I've met you before.
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
Hit me!
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
Why show me?
I'm going to run.
Why tell me?
You know something.
About running, dying what?
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
It's different now. Help me.
Isn't it better like this...?
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
You have to believe to have faith.
You don't believe in anything?
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
Why?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
Yes.
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
She did it.
We don't know that for sure.
All of this so you could capture me?
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
A ragione. A ragione. 
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
What was that?
was saying
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
You live here?
For tonight. 
Oh!
Yes -- oh!
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
Who's your parole officer?
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
How is he?
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
If you want.
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Are you tired of it?
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Well what do you want to talk about?
Anything. Anything at all.
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Oh my God.
Well?
No --- how does it go?
And I thought you were only after my body.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
It won't.
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
Let's turn on the radio.
Radio! What is radio?
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Vodka tonic.
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
Put me down....
They won't fight with me....
Fellas.
Hey, Sam.
Don't fight.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
He should pay.
I don't know.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
What's he looking for?
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Perfect dozen.
Each egg has to be perfect.
The quest isn't going well?
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
I can't.
What?
Clear the area. This is an order!
Fuck him.
Don't.
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
But will he be house-trained?
What happened?
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
What have you got there?
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
Those things never work. Never.
Each of us gets a belt.
Oh, you're both so naive.
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
Video lock.
You got thirty minutes.
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
How would you rate this one?
What the hell you want to go there for?
You know it?
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
Esther!
We made it, didn't we?
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Electra.
Just Electra?
Yeah.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
'I hope your dreams come true.'
'They won't.'
I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
You look well, Charlotte.
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
I don't know.
It was a stupid thing to do.
It was.
Welcome Home.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
You all right?
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
I'll go with ya.
Who are you?
We hung out last night, remember?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
You little fuck.
What?
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
Why know?
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
No.
Where is it?
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
Give it back? Are you nuts?
You pawned it.
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
A favor?
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
Oh, I'm sorry --
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
Are they really?
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
You're doing everything yourself?
Yeah.
How were things between you and Frank?
He was all right to me.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Nicer than most.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Yes.
Though nicer than most?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week?
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
What was bugging Frank?
That oughta do it.
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
What about that guy this morning?
You mean Shelly?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Fuck, what's his name?
What are you so grouchy about?
Where were you, Whistler?
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
Lowe's car-?
Blue. This blue.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
What'd ya mean?
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
What?
I need a favor.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
A bit.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
I won't lie.
I don't want you to lie.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
You seem very sure about that.
Come here.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Then why are you here?
Curiosity.
So keep painting.
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
So what?
So shut up and keep painting..
What time is it?
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
So am I.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Then why does she act so dumb?
Who?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Two men left town right after it happened.
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
I wouldn't know.
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
You're very macabre.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
You okay?
Yeah.
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
How?
...free-lance. You know.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Why do you say that?
Jack, you with us?
Actually, I don't think so.
Damn it.
What's the matter?
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
Good-bye, Dil
Jimmy?
What?
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Where to?
To see a man about a thing.
Graham...
He admitted it.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
We can change our names.
We can live in a hacienda.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
It'd have to be pretty good.
Where are you going?
Up.
And leave me down here???
Make up your mind.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
I talked you into this?
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
Are you coming...?
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
Objection, we've...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
National?
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
What do you think?
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
What did you want?
I made macaroni.
It's always so quiet here.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
Practically no one.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
And the carrying charges?
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
He's just been for a walk.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
Rifle?
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
It seems highly intelligent to me.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
Blue soup?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Sounds quite beautiful.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
Like what?
Yeah, okay. 
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
Yeah.
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
No, I... uh, didn't know that
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Still clear?
Yep.
What?
You ever just stand still for a minute?
Other than that... You all right?
Release the power with the power.
I don't know...
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I...I can't do that.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
That's not what I mean.
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
Thanks... for the drink.
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
And...?
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
You didn't think much about that before.
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Well...
What the fuck!
You said it looked like a car accident.
What the fuck!
When aid you get home last night...?
What were you talking about...?
Where to?
I write.
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
Doug...Bob McClane.
Nice to meet you.
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
But...I...400 years?
An' this?
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
Can I go swimming?
Tommy!
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
Where is it?
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I'm stranded out here.
Huh?
It is as you are.
Come on.
What's the matter?
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Who's Horace?
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
Thank you, Uncle.
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Yes, sir.
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
My room!
Mine, too.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
Got it Earl.
Lock this asshole up.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
What was that?
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
What about her arms?
Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
Shit!
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
...are you Phil...?
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
Is Linda here?
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
Don't wanna miss this.
You're glowing again.
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
Who's that?
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
Nick, the ice is --
Invitations.
Invitations?
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
Shut up.
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
Why?
... just, you could look very heavy...
Don't make conversation with me.
What?
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
He doesn't bite.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Baker.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
I won't hurt you.
What if I say no?
What is it we can do for you today?
Spying?!
I can take care of myself.
Oh, really?
And you were a student also.
Yes.
At college.
Yes.
What was your major?
Why are you asking me all this?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Art.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
And I thought we were getting on so well.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
You weren't dreaming about me.
I could save you the trouble.
No trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...
Okey-dokey, go ahead.
What 
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
Do you want me to?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Maybe it's gone.
It was at that.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
I can see the hatch.
So, two days?
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
I want to leave right now.
I'm gonna leave now.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
This is the place.
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
The Idiot?
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Great, thanks for the tip.
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
So you're hot on this stock?
What have you been told so far?
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
Anything else?
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
Well... the couch would be all right...
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
You wouldn't be putting me out.
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Kim?
That's your name, isn't it?
You always call me Miss Brewster.
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
I don't know.
Shopping?
No.
Well... anywhere in particular?
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Well... why don't you move back?
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
I... I...
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
I'm on a break.
Oh no -- oh no!!
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
Uh... bye-bye.
Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
He never told about the money.
No.
What do you figure he done with it?
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
Dunbar.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Buttfucks the cabin?
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
That bugs you too?
Little bit.
Your house is so beautiful.
Thank you.
It's just the three cent.
It's terrific!
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
Yah.
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
Yah, I guess.
Hello... send him up.
Who's that?
Yes, why?
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
STEPHANIE?
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
He's giving them up?
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
But you call this room the "temple".
Just a nickname.
Right.
People can see.
It's just us now.
Where you going?
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Maybe cause he's smart.
My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.
No harm done.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Is it weird?
The mark? Yes.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
I will.
You will what?
I have recorded the transmission.
Mr. Spock, your computations?
In progress, Admiral.
It's those rocks, up there.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
Dien Bien Phu?
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Yes.
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Huh-huh.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Which ones?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
I'm sorry to hear that.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
Water...water...
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Oh!
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
How many came back?
Yeah, that's right.
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
Your Highness.
How do you do, my friend.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
My jewels?!
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
We keep them.
You keep them.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
Huh?
There's a seat over there for you.
What's the idea?
I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind. 
Wife?
Yeah. Come oncome on!
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Who's your decorator?
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
They'll trace it.
I'm sorry.
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
What?
Increase positive pressure!
That's our reserve air.
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
And they loved Bear.
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
What's wrong?
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
Just what?
Are you all right?
What're they on about?
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Thanks.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
We were just trying to push the envelope --
So why are you asking me?
See! That shimmering area.
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
Damnit...
What?
Glasses.
He's the one who wants you.
It was the other guy who busted me.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
That's wise, Tommy.
WillWhere is Mercutio?
Then what'd you come here for?
There's Times Square.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Just keep quiet.
I have to answer him.
So you can give us away?
You think?! Based on what?
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
No one follows that midrash.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
Do we shake hands?
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
Why?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Where's that airlines bag?
Lord, you're stubborn.
What are you doing?
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
What?!
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
How long is it going to take?!
What is it?
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
And you believe it?
Where the hell is he?
Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Count of three?
Why not just go now?
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
No, I didn't know that.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
No.
I know what you're getting at.
You do?
I've seen it before.
You have?
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
Okay.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
We meant only to please you.
Woody, stop it!!
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
But why?
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
Afraid of what?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
-- About what?
About Chinatown. What went down.
What went down?
You tell me, man.
No. You tell me, Shu.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
Gimme this god-...
...-damn phone.
 Talk to me.
Carl, what are you doing?
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
I thought that was the end of the song.
I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
Ask this one favor --
It could be parasites, an infection...
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
I've never treated you like a whore.
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
I'll look forward to it.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
Watch it!
None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
Dickie, my God!
Hello Meredith.
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
What?
Just kidding. Are you alone?
McKinney's the name.
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
Little boy?!  That's him!
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
Nobody says you have to be like me.
He does.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
I want some more.
So what did he say when he called?
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
Don't mention it.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
What is it?
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
But why do you want me?
What did she do to you?
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Wadda you think?
Maybe I can change him.
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
Well, you know--
He's got his priorities?
Tom, you okay?
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
You okay?
Yeah, of course.
What do you want?
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
Did you take your things over to my place?
Uh-huh!
Run into Josh?
Yeah, but it was okay.
What have you done?
Lynette, where's Sid?
Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
We've made a lot of pictures together.
And you'll play Salome?
Who else ?
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Fair enough.
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
They'll love it in Pomona.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
Yo son, check this out.
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
I thought I was the bad guy!
Stay up there, Girl...
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Hmmmm, interesting.
What?
You have no personality.
Hey, where does it say that?
Those are cold.
Uh-huh.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
And his wife?
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
Oh, my.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
No, thank you -- what's your name?
Belle --
No THX.
No --
So, Ramona!
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
Who screamed?
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
I better go.
What's the matter?
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
He isn't to be touched.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
That one.
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Three years.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
That's not what they're tellin' me.
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
It's probably because you got him fired.
Ya think?
Screw you.
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
'Terrorists?'
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
Excuse me?
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
And then what?
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
How long do I have?
Are you at peace with your family?
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
Goals are important.
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
Nothing is easy.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
Six months.  Eleven days.
What did you say?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
But how... how do you know my name?
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
There they are!
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
No, don't go away!
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Who? Miss Dawson?
Yes, sir.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
You smell that.  You smell that?
What?
Then what did she do?
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
Oh, thank you.
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well I appreciate that.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
Of course, of course...
So...
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
New?
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
...repeat, we're armed...
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
Help someone!
You can't tell your parents.
Ok.
Especially not your dad.
I won't.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Stag?
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
I can't right now.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
I'm staying.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
She didn't push me into coming.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
What?
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
Why did she have to die?
Only God knows the answer to that.
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnt have to sleep with you to find that out.
He used your exact words.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
Who is he?
He's my younger brother.
You have a brother?
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
I think you better put that away.
If only we could get a fix.
Violet Bick!
Don't screw around man, pull it!
You do it... you first!
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
You first!
How do you know about Eugene?
Tell me more about Cabot.
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
I did, yeah.
Vox --
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
No.
Why not?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
The deal.
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
We got company. Female company.
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
We're breaking up. I am out!
You knew what I'd do.
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
She don't look no worse to me.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
What did you say, boy?!
I said, she's in great shape.
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Another dozen out back.
They gonna rush us?
Are you okay?
I heard they were filthy birds.
You can't be serious?
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
Roger, no.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Bad habit.
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
When was that?
I've run out of words.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Well, what about us?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Oh, no, no, no.
You're unbelievable.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
Over my dead body.
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
I know you will.
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
Later.
I could say the same thing about you.
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
Who's playing?
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
Lufkin. His... agent.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
But you are interested?
I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
How do you suggest I go about it?
Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
Tachlinkov.
A lot of Persians?
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
Want a smoke?
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Thanks.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
What's going on?
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
Who isn't?
You been followin' the news coverage?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
Susanville, Soledade.
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
Did you jiggle the phone?
No.
Did you hear that click?
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Yeah?
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
What happened?
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Do you know where he went?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Who, Benny's little sister?
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
No.
Who was that?
I don't know.
What's this?
How you feeling?
I don't get it.
This business is about taking risks.
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
Hey, what are you doing here?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Hello?
Mr. Thomerson.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Yes I did.
Fine. How's everything going?
And I want to try to make it up to you.
I don't know - I'm American.
So?
We think in miles, not kilometers.
So how many miles do you think it is?
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
The moron?
He's not a moron.
And who's Lydia?
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
I... You're not going to understand this.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
What does that mean?
See, I told you!
Well, what the hell does that mean?
Well, are you?
Am I what?
I told her today I need to end it.
Is that what you want?
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
Yes.  Like that.
This an accident, Walter?
What's that, written on the sail?
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
The Obliterators!
You coming, Boone?
He's here.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
But she just got here...
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
What did you expect - live sables?
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
All right -- it's said!
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI don't quite know what to say . . .
Carnes? Wait.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
You know Sid Fletcher?
What?
You know Sid Fletcher?
I work for him.
Do you?
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
Fine.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
Should we knock?
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Find them everywhere. 
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Which is?
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Money.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I don't know. You tell me.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
A hunting accident is perfect.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
You paid $50,000 for your character?
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
That's your dog.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
There isn't any us.
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
No, you may not.
I loved it blond.
His profession?
Well, he worked around.
And his age?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Any other family?
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
What message?  What motorboat?
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
Oh, he does!
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
And where's he going to be?
He's going to be ashore with you.
With ME?
That's right.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
Okay. Repeat this after me.
It is, Billy.
Did he say a wolf?
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
Where we going -- ?
I've decided not to run for President.
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
This is Quint, Missus.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
He's busy.
Well... is everything all right?
I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
Psychic awareness. Right.
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
What?
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
You better get some sleep.
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
And what is that?
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Here, Chaz.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
Stay out here.
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
So what Jew would you kill first?
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
God in heaven, what is that?!
If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
What are you talking about?
That's Sherry VanHafton.
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Something's screwy here.
Are you alright?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
What's it doing?
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
I was talking with someone!
Did you cry when your father died?
Yeah.
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
...Wes...?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
We don't have time for hysterics.
We don't?
More the merrier.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
I never had sex with you!
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
Do you know how to disable the injector?
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Like I said, I...
What's your name?
We followed your instructions.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
Do you remember him?
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
Johnny 
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
Not French registry?
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Oh, please...
Can we talk some more when you get here?
What kind of activity?
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Someone broke into this room.
Anything missin'?
What are you doing in New York...?
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
Incredible.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
Exactly.
He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
Tell her you need to see her.
Should I?
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
More.
...Joe.
You should call her.
I will.  See ya!
Right now.
Why did you do that?
I felt like it.
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Got any crazy eights?
Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
What other job you got?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
I don't wanna work at all.
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
... that's all right.
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
You touch me again and--
You son of a bitch!!
Lester.
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
Of course he is.
Not here, Duff.
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
But I would like to see you again.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
What d'you mean?
You almost got into trouble back there.
I wouldn't have let you.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
No, on the porch.
Oh yeah, and then what?
What?
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
We don't know anything about it
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
How'd they get onto you?
Mind if I smoke?
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rsum, make an --
Tell them to come on in.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
It doesn't matter who they are.
And one of 'em is sick.
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
I put them on together.
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
Help yourself.
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
I'm not sure.
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Yeah, wasn't I?
Morning!
Erin?  What are you --
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Shep said 8:30.
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Ya got the car?
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Madrigal's alive.
What?
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
What do you mean?
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
Yes, it just shows  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
Okay, brother.
Don't call me brother.
I could eat a horse.
I think that's what you ordered.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
How was I leading you on?
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
That's right.
Oh!
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
No -- I guess not.
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
What?
You don't know.
I think we got a couple of live ones.
Brody's riding his tower.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
He did something with the ground.
Yes?
Can you do it?
I don't know.
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
How about dangerous curves?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
I've got to stop him.
Better believe it.
How did you know my name?
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
This is California, anything is possible.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
Don't go in.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
Yes, mom?
We're not finished yet --
Why do you always wear that hat?
Senorita Josie.
Jason's here in New York.
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
In there.
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
A magic dishcloth.
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
Is this your dad?
That was him.
Is he dead?
Please put it down.
How'd he die?
Leia!
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
So Nix won't come looking for her?
It's me betrayed him.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
I don't know what else to do.
Well, what'd you think?
I think we're on the right track.
Who're you calling?
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Trail him!  Trail who?
You're weird.
I'm sorry.
That was a compliment.
Will you go with me?
Where are we going?
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Goodnight.
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
You don't know him -
Hello?
What's up?
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
This is ridiculous!
Somebody say somethin'?
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Well, whatta we got here?
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
Let's go.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Miss Bennett please!
Want to get a drink?
Do you think George is a fairy?
Who?
That kid... the hairdresser.
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
No, you're not wrong--
Am I wrong!
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
But you like that in a man?
You should write that one down.
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
Some prep school thing.
Does it have a human name?
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
I'd never admit that.
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
I hear things in this house,
All new houses have noises.
How long does it have to be a new house?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Moving in?
I came right from the airport.
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
Be careful.
I'm trying.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
So I'm told.
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
What are you talking about?
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Alfred's happy here.
I wish to see my mother.
She's busy.
Convey her a message.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
Fuck is up?!
Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
Long ago -- before my father's father.
Yes, sir.
We make love?
What's on the call sheet?
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Decorated?
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
So?
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
I'm sorry.
Come on, let's go.
Where?
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
Do you even know these kids?
I got something on the screen.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
Not by the thousands.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
So what brings you out tonight?
You gotta use your imagination.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
Not quite. This is my field.
Is there anything that isn't?
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
We should have stayed and finished them off.
I didn't even know you had a kid.
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
We're all assholes, Bernie?
In what way?
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Laura.
Back to California
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
I did find him!
What do you mean?
He was down in the shop.
Nick!
It was his body that was buried there.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's a fact.
Wynant's body?
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
Huh?
What things made you so sure?
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Well, don't they?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
Do you have to say that?
What?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
I say it because it's descriptive.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Well, I wonder why.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
I have a pretty good idea.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
He doesn't have a phone.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
But he won't.
What are you talking about?
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
Let me talk to him first.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
And what?
Is it snowing?
Yeah, just started.
Where's your coat and hat?
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his 
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Who's he?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
That's your problem.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
That's not Fred Madison?
No, sir, it's not.
Who is it?
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
Yeah, Mack?
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
What's that?
You said I was a lady in distress.
Oh, that
What did you mean by that?
You signed out twice.
I what?
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Oh - you're an actress.
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Who killed your patient?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Aye sir --
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
Ready, Ma?
She okay?
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
Why?!
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
Who is there?
Bertrand, sire.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
Yes, sire?
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
No, sire... I was asleep.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
No, I will not step outside.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
Impossible.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
President vetoes works bill?
Let's go.
So you dropped by to apologize?
You what?
I want to be the way I was before.
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
You disappointed?
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
What?
You smell like baby powder.
So do you.
I never felt so clean before.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
It is for me too.
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
You...
Moreover...
What?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
What brown hands you have.
That's from skiing.
Skiing? 
He didn't join them. They joined him.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
He is the King.
Who?
Is everything all right?
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Anchor?
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
Oh.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Which way?
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
Hello?
We should have seen land.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Who?
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
What do you want to know?
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Detective Niccoletti?
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
What for? Who are you?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
Do you live here in the hotel?
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
He was standing right here.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
-- Anyway.
I hope she's all right.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
No, I know.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
I know.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
Calloway!
What are you doing?
We're going to need some time.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
What am I doing?
You're charming the boy.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
There were some shots.
What're you talking about?
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Where?
Here in the canyon.
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
What's gonna happen?
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
Well, like what?
It hurts.
Where?
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
About what?
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Then why don't you change jobs? 
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
No...
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
That's great.
Sean's asleep.
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
Don't get too cocky.
Why not?
You can make a mistake.
What does that do?
I'm fine.
No, you're not....
What are you doing here?
He wants to talk to you.
Now it's okay?
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Well, there's not much to tell.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Bad experiences.
You met people.
Bad people.
Watched television?
Bad television.
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
What's that?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
It's beautiful.
It's a --
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
When?
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
No, I just told you what happened.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
Colonel - shooting's no good!
It's always been a good persuader.
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
...excuse me.
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
Do you know his number?
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
So you're a lawyer.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Do you practice here?
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
What kind of law?
Criminal.
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Let's not over do it...
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
Makes you gag.
Gag on your own invention, then.
Oh, come now...
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
What a nice place.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
And the vampires of the Theatre?
Get some sleep.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Well what's wrong?
Well why are they tearing the building down?
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
An INCIDENT?
Do we report this, sir?
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
Thirty-two and change.
I was getting to it.
Getting to what?
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
Case.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
I hesitated taking that much.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
I didn't know... I --
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
Cathay?
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
East of Mercia?
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
Flozen foleva not good.
It's terrible.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
You come stealee tleasoo?
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
No, I  I didn't mean to sound 
What DID you mean?
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
Protection?
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
I guess we each have something the other wants.
I guess we do.
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
Your phony FBI assholes.
We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
What do you mean by that?
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
What?
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
Ive scheduled a medical for you.
Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Right first time.
What are you drinking?
Just soda.
Plain soda?
Please.
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
That depends.
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
Calm down, Dave, what?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
What did they...
You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
It leads farther than that.
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
...give me protection?
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
This thing's going nowhere.
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Please, let's not stop, George.
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
Radio said negative five.
Negative five?
Yeah.
I don't think it's negative five.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
What about Schulz?
Have you consulted a psychic?
No.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
That's so typical, isn't it?
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Nothing.
People just...disappear.
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
You can?
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
What do you wish me to do?
Kittle...
We'll let you know tomorrow.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Hey, Kat.
And this chest?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Just some flies.
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
They ain't got captains?
You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
Is that so?
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
I don't?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
JENNIFER!
...No...
You see, like you and I...
You are extremely sexy.
No, I'm not.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
Can I get my life back?
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
She told me.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
What do we do?
You got a bag or somethin?
No.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
A little longer, Paul?
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
Who told you that?
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Has he gotten through to any?
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
I've heard of it happening.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
You the only sentry?
The message!  I figured out--
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
You going to tell dad?
Would it matter?  And what's that?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
No!
Did you find her?!
Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Philip Swann?
You know of him?
I saw him in Vegas once.
Are you a gambling man?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
What's the difference?
But --
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
Arriving tonight
Gin? Where the hell are you?
I'm in the middle.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
He's on to something bigger.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Too late now.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Sure.
You're the one who found the bodies?
Yes.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
No, nothing.
You knew these people?
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
Are you mad?
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
Okay, Jason, your move.
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
Stop that.
How about you tryin' to make me?
Did you talk to him?
Jesus.
I don't know what to do, Bob.
You deaf or what?
Nice. Very nice.
Twelve months in oak.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown.
Since when?
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Dick Low's a killer too.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
You worry about me really?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
I don't know.
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
...don't talk.
Where'd you get this?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
What's he so excited about?
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Look at all this junk.
How's he doing?
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
I don't believe that.
Wheres the sub going?!
No!  Get me out!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
Hey, hi!
Well? How do you like it?
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Too little.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
You guys got the Latin homework?
What, Sebastian?
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
The fuck I will!
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
That's right?
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
I need it.
Now?
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
Don't worry about it, all right?
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
Relax. I know what you meant.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
No thanks, I quit.
You quit?
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
No.
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
Where's the money?
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
Push off toward us.
I've changed.
We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning.
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Stop it.
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
Something I want?
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Cut.
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
She told me I have to.
No, Jim.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
But then I won't need your money.
Oh
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
You wanna talk to her alone?
Yeah.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
Holy cow.
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
Oops!
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Do you love him, Loretta?
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Where are you going?
I'm taking a shower.
Need any company?
No.
Want a blow job?
Good night Cecile.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
Is this blackmail?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Is this whitemail?
Fair's fair.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Why won't you answer me?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
I don't know you.
You've lived with me for two years.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
You know goddamn well what I mean.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
How you get all this money?
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
Cell phone.
Don't know what you're talking about.
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
Listen, you don't havta come?
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
Dad?
Who was it?
You are at the University, Candy?
Yes, I am.
And what are you studying?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Eh, Poli Sci?
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid Im in love with somebody else.
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
This life.
This life?
Why do I have this life?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
Thirty-seven.
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
What are you doing here?!
I came to see you.
I can see that.  Why?
Can I come in?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Then you come out here.
Then I'll get caught.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
It's an unfair advantage.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Okay, knock it off.
Truce?
Truce.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
How in hell does it wind up?
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Would you please repeat the destination?
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
That's right.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
The pumps --
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
Mom, I mean dad?
Yeah?
Diz!
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
What!
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
They must've taken it off me.
They?
Nifty.
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
Stella.
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
He's going back.
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
What was that?
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
It does.
Do you find him attractive?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
No. But when he's in that car...
Have you seen his penis?
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
Keep what handy?
Nothing.
Just something I'm trying.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
So what is it?
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Yeah ...
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
No. She really liked you.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
What?
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
Brad, you are drunk.
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
Why is she leaving me?
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
"Because we don't have any money."
....because we don't have any mmm...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
You ask what room he's in, okay?
There's ways around that.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
The Paper Street Soap Company.
Can I come in?
He's not here.
What?
What's he doing daddy?
He's blessing the house.
Why?
I'm terribly sorry.
-- never mind.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
-- no.
Good for you.
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
Stop.
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
Do you miss it?
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Nothing.
And when she goes to those places...
Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." 
Go on!
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Well, there is that ...
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
Fuck you.
And this guy is...
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Gustafson's accountant.
Yah.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
- looking.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Still missing. We're looking.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
Yes, Master!
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
What is your name?
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
Shut up!
OK. Say what it is.
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
Where did you stop last?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where did you stop last?
Stay right there...
What was your last stop?
Elmo's...
Where's that?
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
Press a button and they give us money.
Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
You just got a Mickey.
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
What did ya do?
I'm a robber.
You're a bank robber?
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
What?
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
How?
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
Tell me.
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
I don't hear it anymore.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
It sounded like Brenda.
I'll go take a look.
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Let me drive you home.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
Jimmy Bones?
Yeah, you heard of him?
You haven't?
Not that I remember.
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
Any word from Canada?
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
We're carrying weight.
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
The Widow of the Web?
Yes.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
She has the power of vision.
She has the power to kill.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Her name is Death.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
You down?
Yeah, we're down.
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
Who's the honcho around here?
I am. Hur you?
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
No.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
That's it?
Yeah.
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
No.
What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
We'll find the evidence.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
Any word on my Dad?
We gonna live here?
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
I like the tent better.
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
Apart from those shotguns.
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
Why are you doing this to me?
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
I trusted you.
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
Just checking.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
Yeah.
So, it's over?
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
It's ... lovely.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
What did she do to me?
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
I felt like she almost killed me.
If she held on any longer she could have.
That won't happen again.  We're different.
How about if I try humility.
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
I don't know. Should you?
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
The long end. Big con.
Nobody does that single-o.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
I've heard the name.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
Is that right?
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Yes... they were.
Good.  Where are the English?
Everywhere.  Where is the food?
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
I know...
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Where is Banister in all this?
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Is she?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
What are you going to do to him?
I'm going to try to remove it.
...I'm sorry...
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I am. Yeah.
Without peer?
You know what's happened, don't you?
What?
We've gone insane.
Time to change her diaper.
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
The preacher said it absolved us.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Thank you.
How?
Oh!
Oh, is that what it is?
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Right.
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
Who?
Kubelik.
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
A.W.O.L.?
Call them back.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
Gay.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Really?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
He was hot, wasn't he?
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
What is it?
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
He didn't say anything?
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
What?
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
Right.
Why are you going here? What is here?
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Good-morrow, cousin.
Is the day so young?
But new struck cuz.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
In love?
Out--
Of love?
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
No, cuz, I rather weep.
Good heart, at what?
At thy good heart's oppression.
Farewell, my cuz.
Come on. One more time.
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
Mickey?
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
I don't want you to wait for me.
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
What are you serious?
The <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>Terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...
Hello, <u>King</u>.  How the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>Get</u> out...  <u>Get</u> out... Well, man, you fall in love like a <u>Hillbilly</u>...  Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick-up,   Listen, King:  <u>Get</u> your fat redneck ass out here, <u>willya</u>...
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
Yes.
Why did you lie to me?
It's okay, it's okay.
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
..it's really about family and tradition...
..harmonica style is okay.
Who are "they?"
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
Then, what good are you?
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
That's a lie...
Ready sir.
Tripp?!
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
Peugot convertible ...
What color?
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
Okay. I guess so.
Ben, come in.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
Thank you.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
From a -- girlfriend.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
I'm sorry, but I...
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
Yeah.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Hear what?
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Kay-Em, you okay?
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
Now what?
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Dad!
What?
Dad!
What?
Are you there, Fran?
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
I'm not in trouble.
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
But, Paulie, please.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
Return to our own time?
Yes, sir.
You should know something.
I don't want to talk any more.
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
What's wrong?
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
That's a terrific idea.
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
Who told you we deal drugs?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?

If you've lied to me to me --
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Daddy!
Yes, Amy?
Walter?
Yes?
Yes.
Why?
What do you know about them?
...<u>nothing</u>...
Precisely.
What did Albania ever do to us?
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
Come into the study a minute.
Did you call, sir?
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
Fuckin' freezing.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Five years. Since it opened.
How long ago was your makeover?
My what?!
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
What?  What did he say?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Christ...where's Rennie??
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
What do you have in your purse?
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
He sure loves to stay awake.
So you're practically finished, huh?
...has been simply unbearable.
Oh.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Now where are you going?
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
I don't know.
What does that mean?
Listen to what you want.
You're looking fit.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
God. How can you eat like that?
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
That's It?
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
How do I load?
Drive for a minute.
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
Hello, Sid.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
No. I'm not busy.
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Yeah!
Wash her.
What with?
Where did you get it?
I. sold the car.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Who's he barking at now?
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
That's a terrible thing to say.
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Who is he?
He's in charge.
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
Wow
Who's here!?
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
Who?
Hello.
Wow!
What?
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
Oh.
I've got a gig tonight.
Oh?
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
Doesn't it have a name?
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
His yacht?
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
I'm a what?
Now, is your shit together?
What you doing, Jimmy?
I'm not sure.
Do you like me even a little bit?
Aaagh!
Yes.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I'll be out in a minute.
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?
I... How long have I been here?
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
I was saved at the last minute.
How?
Andy...
Yeah?
Yes?
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
Then we cannot go.
Because...?
Time?
Can you sleep?
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
You killed her!
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
Where are the tapes?
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
A pass.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
They don't have a murder weapon?
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
Foreigners! Fuck!
What about us?
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
No, I didn't.
Why not?
Because I never got around to it.
Well, why?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
No!
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
No, it's nothing like that.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Well, what, then?
I don't want to talk about it.
Then why'd you call me?
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Then who wrote the report?
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
You're really never going to make love again?
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Don't do that.
Then what'll you do?
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
Well , who's in command here?
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
Have a drink?
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
Carlos had some great rock.
What is it?
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
About a dozen.
You had some questions.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's a fact, isn't it?
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
When? Today?
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Right, right...
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Right.
So he killed himself.
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
What's up?
No questions.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
Jesus Christ!
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
I'll be okay.
What did you do to the batteries?
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
What happens in tow and a half hours?
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
No, sir.
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
Thank you.
Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
Didn't I?
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
Sixteen dollars.
I know.
Doctor Soran?
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Come on, Z.
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away.
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
Who are you calling?
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
Come on!
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
A hundred and one next month.
Do you think he knows?
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
So where do we begin?
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
So what do I get in return?
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
I can't.
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
Do you have children?
No.
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
...long overdue.
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
How?
Shit!  He jumped!
Jumped where?
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Well we're off and running.  Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.
Acquired?
We know that, son.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
I've continued working on the case!
Hi!
Yes?
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Yes?
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
That you, Sail, honey?
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
We're using-
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
Barks his consternation.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
That a fact?
Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.
How would I get a loan, anyway?
You need collateral.
Like this?
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
You let us worry about that.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
What do you think would be in order?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Hurry! She's lost it!
You are so damn sexy.
Vince...
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
I did.
Who the fuck is he?
Are you alright, Wade?
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Always has been.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Who?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Who?
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
When'd you do it?
If it's too hot, open your tie.
I wish to say something.
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
Yes, Ma.
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
How old are you?
Oh, please...
That's not that much.
Ten minutes.
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
No way.
Ah - - they're here.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Thanks for picking me up.
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
That must make it tough.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Oh. Well I am.
Hm?
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
'That right? Good for you.
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
Really.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
Get away from there, convict!
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
Who was that at the door?
Why did they block the door again?
I want to go home.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
What?
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
...Where're we goin'?
That-a-boy. Hospital.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
Must be.
Pride of a job-well-done...
What are you going to do!?
Is anyone there?
Look.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Bela, what happened?!
I didn't feel well...
Let me take you to the hospital.
Say something.
What?
I'll go.
What?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
Nice work, Norman.
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
No shortage of suspects.
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
What's the first?
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Winifred.
Hi! Star.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
I won first prize.
What are you thinking?
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
You're not trying to run away?
Yes, Sir.
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head - maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone 
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
So it's true, then?
What?
You like me better like this.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
No, I don't.
Why not?
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
Yeah.
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
What?
So...  That your first time?
Yes'sir.
It's bait.  Don't take it.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
Claire...
Sonny -
Yeah ...
I never been up in a plane before.
There's ... another exit?
Fifty-five.
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
Yes it is...
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
So there is only one key...
That's right...
And it can't be forged?
Is there anything else you want to know?
Where you were when your husband died.
I can't tell you.
You mean you don't know where you were?
I mean I can't tell you.
Monstrous.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Your lips, they didn't move.
I beg your par---
When did she die...?
Who is this...?
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
Get your hand off me.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
Go fuck yourself.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
Now he's making stuff up about me.
Really?
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
Did you know? Had you heard?
What?
The marriage!
Well, what does it matter to you?
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
He a Black man or an Indian?
What the devil --
I swear, Satch.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Uh, huh.
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
Thank you, sir.
Beetle!
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Yes.
Where are you now?
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
Are you hurting her?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
He knows I do not love him.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
Not I - I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano - "My courage like a white plume"  and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
I understand.
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
I'm so frightened.
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
Those creatures..!
Don't let them hear you.
What can we do?
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
Yes.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
You'll call me, right?
Yeah.
When?
Tomorrow?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Did you study for the test?
How is he?
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
More wine!!
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
You can do it.
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
Three days.
Three days??!!
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
You went for it.
In the abstract...
So I'm making it concrete.
Why?
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Do you need five grand?
Is that what I just said?
You need money?  Is that the...
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
I do?
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
Thanks.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
The who?
Brill?
I've got a place I can hide her.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
Yes, he knew.  Just..
..not in time to save him.
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
We're not canceling.
I know.
I won't even discuss it.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Yeah. You.
Goodnight, Spock.
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
And Sanctuary?
Frederick Frankenstein?
Fron kon steen!
Are you putting me on?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
No, Fred ereck.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I see.
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Thank you.
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
Natalie? Natalie who?
She finds him.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
Wanna try it from the top?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
... Who are you?
Everybody does.
We should go now.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
Thought you were going to bring her.
Which floor?
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
How do I get the horn back?
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Not very precise directions.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
Ask away, sweet man.
What became of the princess?
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Is she fair, this princess?
Exceeding fair.
As fair as me?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
She's dead!
No!
Dead, dead, dead.
I don't believe you.
What the --
What is it?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
So?
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
... He ought to put him in here.
It's too soon to move him.
So tell Calvin.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Where's the gangsta of love?
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
Now what?
Ohhh, I hate this.
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I mean...
Daddy!
Oh God!
You're hurting me!
Stop!!!!
Daddy. Let go.
What do you want from me?
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Don't know.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
Who's got him?
The heelots!
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
And you agreed?
Yes.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
What would that make Mom?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
Why didn't you go?
Too old.
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
Your new car. 
- Four wheel drive?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
Where are we sending it?
What's this?
One of us?
I'll talk to your father.
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
But I like that one, Scottie.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
We was coming to see you.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
D.C., Chief.
YOU HURT ME.
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
Maybe the Feds got it.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
You want us to wait for you?
What are you doing here?
Were they trying to kill you?					*
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
And you chased one?
Is he alright?  What happened?
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Do I have to?
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
I wisht it was day.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Man bones?
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
Why have you done this?
In case you get back before I do.
Where are you going?
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
We're in business.
Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Old?
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
. . . What?
You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
You lost Ben?!
...what happened...?
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
Ta.
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
There's nothing to forgive.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
You are right.  But it is a trap.
I think you had better both come inside.
I have to go now, before it gets light.
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
- I told you! He was there! -
No bother.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
-- Where have you two been?
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Excuse me?
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
Did he shut you down?
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
You mean a general strike?
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
That was way back...
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
That looked rather painful.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
Where 're you going?
I'm not like you.
What...?
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
Does he have the spot?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
What do you think?
True.
Kirk here.
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
In my quarters, Uhura.
I want to ride my own bike.
My Dad always drives my Mom.
So?
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
No -- don't out me off.
...set up some more things.
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
I'm sure that's it. 
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Yes... yes, I do.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Yes it does.
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Start with what you knew then.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
What are you talking about?
I'm done talking. Get out.
You can't do this.
This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.
Pleased to meet you.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
Something like that.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
What the fuck do you want from me?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
You think that's too much?
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
So?
What?
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
wasn't anywhere near this place
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
You look upset.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
What's this?
The main spire.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
A son.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
Talk to me, Charlie.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
I told you you'd get your money back.
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
Hong Kong.
What?
I've found it.
Found what?
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
Oh, hello.
If you know where it is, get there!
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
What are you supposed to do?
How you doin' Barry?
Hi Walter.
How's business?
Willow Ufgood.
Yes...?
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
You did it for Namath.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
I can't move my arm.
He was murdered.
Who did it?
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Oh no.
What?
I've got to go.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
He talked to you Himself?
No.
Through someone else?
Yes.
Who?
I can't say.
Why?
She'd punish me.
One of the other Sisters?
No.
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
You first.
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
This is real, Bananahead!
So?
Do you think I must?
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
So is that your boyfriend?
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Well are --
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
Why not?
Because it's what we have to do.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
I got your message. Way to go!
I don't know -- I don't know--
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Here, here! This is it!
Watch it, shithead!
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Since how long?
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Peter sends his regards.
Oh?  How's he doing?
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
No doubt.
Ellie...
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
You know why I'm here.
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
You can't just pull the plug, David.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Meaning...
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
David --
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
I thought you were through with it!
How do you do?
Up to you.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
Sure.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Well, okay. I got you some.
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Ma'am?
Yeah.
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
We sure like havin' you.
That's him alright.
You hungry?
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Take your time.
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
No, no, no.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
Whoa, wait a minute...
What?
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Roll 'em.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
Was I?  I'm sorry.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
Why not?
I just don't.
Heather, what is it?
Well ... come on.
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
I'm hip.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Robot huh?
Kay-em 14.
Barbie from hell...
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
Anya, I think you're crazy.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
No.
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
Tell him I have a fiance, Dickie has a fiance and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
You got it on the board.
No, I need the original note.
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're 
What's that about?
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
You think he's getting out of here?
Will it restore my gift?
How?
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
I don't think I want to hear this --
Hey, sport. You winning?
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
Your brother told us.
Daddy....
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
You're not?
He's the manager!
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
I batted!
You batted or you bunted?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Well, then I'm quitting.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
How romantic.
We think so.
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
Hey!
What?
He's had some sort of...episode.
What?  What kind of episode?
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Like what?
Like Freddy.
They don't build them like this anymore.
Are you all right?
A few years older, perhaps.
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
"Punks", huh?
I guess we can get started.
This is Barry.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Yeah but what are you doing?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
So you can't talk to me?
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
Well, I can't talk though --
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
Yes, I'll be there.
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Thank you --
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
I'm sorry, I can't.
That's me.
No it is not!
Hold still.
Hey, can you guys hear me?
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
It's a pleasure...
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
My God, you're serious.
Ask anybody.
What are the terms?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
What?
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
That can't feel good.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
B-Black...
Where is it?
Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
Whah?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're going to check into something.
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
Why was he missing for twenty days?
A lot of people are looking for you.
I guess that makes you the smart one.
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
Are you even really alive?
Sorry.
What can I say?
Okay.  How did you find me?
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
What are you listening to?
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
Can't make enough swords!
Can't make enough axe-heads!
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Huh!
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
She was looking right at me.
Call him?
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Will I be?
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
But he was called...
What the hell is wrong with you?!
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
It's not optional!
What are you doing ?
Don't deny me, Duff.
Everything breaks at once.
Isn't that always the way?
So, you're just kind of a roving --
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
What's goin' on?
I'll do it.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
I'm sure.
You feel violated?
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
Did you say..."Peggy"?
You've been in this house for a while?
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
I never met her.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
I haven't any.
You haven't got a uniform?
No, sir.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Why, I don't know.
She ever pull down her shades?
Jude?
Yes?
Who's the old geezer?
Is anything wrong, sir?
What? No. Nothing.
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Where is it?
What?
Where is your luggage?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Oh no.
Sir?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
Oh, good. Okay.
See you Monday.
Somewhere safe.
Where?
A place we have, that we know is protected.
We're renegades from despair.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Absolutely.
Why'd you want to help us?
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
They're Seymour's.
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
What a mess.
You can say that again. What do we do?
Don't confuse one organ with another --
I know, because I felt it myself --
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
AND DID YOU?
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
Go to hell!
Why was it you never took her by force?
Who's to say I did not?
Was it impotence?
NEVER!
You scared me.
I didn't aim to.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
And have you mended them?
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
I spaced out.
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
Why not?
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Oh, I see, I see.
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Fifteen years, huh?
Fifteen years, yeah.
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
Let go!
You set me up.
I just wanted --
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
Oh, George ...
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
It's a stretch but I'll manage.
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
To kill me.
You understand obsession better than you let on.
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
That's usually my line.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
Would you? I'm not so sure.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
Excuse me.
Madam should sleep.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
I suppose it is.
What do you want?
I want to speak with you.
Go away, unless you got my money.
What do you know about me?
I know that you used to work with an architect.
Hank?
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
Why were you so careless?
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
Did your voice tell you to jump?
No...
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
No...!
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
That's now what I meant...
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Yes, but...
And you didn't jump of your free will?
No!
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
Somebody hit you?
Pete?
Me, too.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Figured it out.
Figured what out?
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
Is Miss Dugan well?
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
The coward!
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
Do you know who did this?
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
The what!
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
You've got to help around the house!
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
Yah, okay, but, uh -
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
GOT IT?
Hey, where are you?
Thinking.
About?
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
That's classic.
He just may be nuts enough.
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Jesse?
Do something.
Maybe the antenna's broken.
About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
Where'd you get this?!!
Hey! How was your first day at school?
Oh, I'm sorry.
What're you doing?
He's been gone a long time.
Who?
Paul's grandfather.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Down the ... er ...
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Three million.  I counted it twice.
Where's everybody else?
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
What is it, Smythe?
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
What new information?
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
I see that you're expecting.
Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?
Well?
Well what?
Aren't you going to say anything?
What do you want me to say?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
How did you get this gig?
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
You leave something out?
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
And?
And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Say what, Manray?
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
Aw, c'mon.
How ya doing?
What?
What's that?
What did you say?
I said how's it going?
I didn't hear you.
Owww.
No!  It can't be.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
Did you have a nice time?
Alright. Alright...
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
I like that too.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
How am I doin'?
Real good.
See how fast he is -- damn!
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
How be dat?
I don't know who I am.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Thank you.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
I have his journal.
You what?
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
You didn't show it to anybody?
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
No... Jason... please...
I was here!
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Go ahead.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
My encounter.
It's about to be a broken face.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
You think you've found your calling?
It's okay by me, peanut.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
So, now what?
Luthor  --
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
This is the studio where I paint.
How long's this gonna take?
I don't know, man. Ask him?
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
Also boring.
Her assistant?
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
You?  Married?
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Excuse me?
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
So you left her?  Just like that?
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
Yo, Paulie.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Yo, Paulie.
What?
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Looks, huh?
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Hey --
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Don't get mental, man.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Ya always in a bad mood --
Wait... You hear that?
What?
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Captain...?
I don't think there's any sense in --
This it?
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
She lived there.
I'm working trains. Selling.
Bet you like that shit.
Keeps me out of the army.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
Heard where?
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
We are?
It's all going to work.
You're late. Very late.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Rick! Rick, help me!
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
Where the fuck are you going?
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Yeah? Who is it?
How are you two getting along?
JOSH!
You just said very food.
Where is Mr. Sulu?
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
I'm going to open it!
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
You new?
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
You told me you had answers.
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
You've been using me --
I've been using you?!
You didn't know my father --
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
Just when do you start, telling people?
Almost immediately.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
Celebrate? What for?
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
I just did.
Come on.
No way.
What's your name?
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
It's so shameful...
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
You must survive, Luke.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
Ben ... Ben ...
Yo.
Damone. It's Mark.
Mark. What happened to your date?
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
Did you go home and get it?
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
And what would that be?
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Veronica, you look like hell.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
It is a difficult situation.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Pooch, can you move it?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
You said you were visiting friends!
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
Tonight it is.
It's me.
Hi.
Sam, for godsake.

I think I can remember what's on them.
Home sweet home!
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
I also like bananas.
Will it go off?
Maybe. Maybe not.
Honestly, Letty.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
You do it.
Why me?
'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
How so?
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
Just be yourself.
Always good advice.
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
Who?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Never heard of him.
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
Who's gonna outfit us?
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
Do what?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
I do?
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
Excuse me?  Start?
Hit me!
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
You followed me. I can't believe it!
I didn't follow you!
You followed me!
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
Well, what is your definition of following?
Following is different. I was spying.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Yes.
Where do you live?
Excuse me.
Where do you live?
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
They're yours.
They are?
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
Bandit I, do you copy?
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
-- confirming everything we already know --
Let go of me!
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, trs bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandmes services quelquun rcemment... Vous tes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe its there with...
Its not.
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
It doesn't have eyes.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Where do you think you're going?
Who ????
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Is it Japanese?
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
I wouldn't think so.
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
We're supposed to be in school.
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
No!!!
Stay away, Sam.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Well, good.  Good for you.
I know what you're doing.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
You little bitch!
Ufa!
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
Objection.
A girl of spirit.
Go to the roof now.
What for Paul.
I think we went the wrong way.
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
How deep does this go?
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Well, fire away.
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
I did.
Any bit in particular?
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
I've got a better idea...
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
No.
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
Can we have it quiet?
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Bob?
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Yes.
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
How much do I pay him?
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
You're perfect for me, too.
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
In a fire, as I recall.
So Chicago's been good to ya.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
I'm sorry we broke in.
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
How far have you gotten?
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
What's this?
Nothing.
That's a rifle you have?
No.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
No.
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
Yes... I...
You can call me Sister.
... Thank you.
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
Well, what else do we do?
Dr. Crowe?
Yes.
We stand behind all our work.
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
He's Canadian.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
He needn't disturb you.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
That DD-5.
What, the lunatic who --
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
It's not really important.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Why are you being so dramatic?
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
What feeling?
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
The princess is dead.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
I think it might hurt her to know.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
For everyone.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
I can't do that.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
What's your name?
I'm Mary 2.
Where do you live, Mary?
Here.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
I'm very smart.
When do you go up?
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
Fuck your grandmother.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
It's chinchilla.
Oh, it's so soft.
It's nice isn't it?
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
I found it! I found it!
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Your liquor laws..
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
What?!
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
No.
No? No, what?
How many leads have we got?
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
Yes.
How do you know he'd buy them?
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
You haven't talked to him.
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
Hey Jack, hurry up!
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
I can't do that.
Why not?
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Because you killed one of my crew.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great.
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
What time did he get there?
Why?
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
We should head Northeast.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
Who told you that?
Isn't it true?
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
What do we do?
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
What?
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
We really must go, Mr. President.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
True.
The movement!
Who are you, master?
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
...this is magnificent.
...Stanley Moss...
What's happening?
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
Can I ride one sometime...?
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
Yes.
I'll be there in three hours.
I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
I did, didn' I, El?
I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
Oh yeah, what's that?
An alternative literary venue!
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Squatted it.
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
What was it?
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Are you going to the reunion?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
That's part of it.
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
It's always the little things.
Rechannel all safety relays --
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Then you still love me?
Dolphins.  Great.
... Population three hundred million...
Say the greeting again...
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
David! David! I can't believe this!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I'm following you and David, if you-
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
You killed her!
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
Glad to meet you.
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
Yes.
I wanted to speak with you about...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
My wife told me to look into...
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
All in, boss!
Move it out.
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
Uhh - martini?
Olive or eyeball?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Stu Miley.
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
Joe -
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
Dude here.
Who is this?
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
You OK about that?
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
Dada, what's a daikini?
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
What is it?
You wouldn't believe me.
I would.
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
I can't do that --
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
I can't leave when I'm so close.
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
That's absurd --
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
But you must.  It's the only way.
I just got released five minutes ago.
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
That lady is back, sir.
Shut up!
She knows it was our fault!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
How much!?
Hundred-fifty.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
I'm going home!
Told you to stay in the hotel!
You don't have any clothes on.
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
I don't know how to make her funny.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
What what's about?
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
But Charlie  why me? Why 
Who?
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
The tennis player?
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
Did you have an accident in the lake?
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
How was lunch?
Huh?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Oh -- great.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
You're lucky, Flynne.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
Where'd you get this?
Bud brought it to me.
Bud?
Take a drink!
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
Are there any balls down there?!
This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
Thank you, Baron.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Thank you.  It's not important.
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
Won't they come out here?
Hey...!
You're not going to use it, are you?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Sure.
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Ghost a steppin' razor...
Are you enjoying yourself?
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Nice boat, Taransky.
It's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
Kyle?
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
Give me an ETA.
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
I'm gonna propose.
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
I'm glad we got here in time.
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Fine.  He's got a plan
And you're going to lead us.
Yeah. Me?
Yes, you.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
That's right.
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
What?
I actually know this one.
You do?
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
What?
You've got to go to sleep now.
I want to go home...
30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
He had help.
Y'all just act natural.
Where will you go now?
It will end tonight.
Must you fight him?
Yeah?
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Are you?
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
What happens if I want to sneeze?
The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
Mitch, let's turn back.
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Are these your bags?
Price?  What do you mean?
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
But tell me why ...
No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
Yeah.
What did he say?
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Ok.
Hide your laptop here.
No.
You can't bring it.
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
Why?
You guys got something going on downstairs?
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
It's alright, Dad.
I didn't mean to...
I know you --
You know my back -
You want to come along quiet?
How's Atley -- ?
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
Let them go --
How's that?
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You'll leave -- ?
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
When did you first notice this?
I could use a date.
Oh lookit that brunette.
Mornin', son...
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
Cannon or Gatling?
Both would be nice.
Hey.
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
What terrific story?
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
Is Elvis out?
When?
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Oh yes. That's fine.
Sorry.
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
When I have no reason to doubt.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
I'm not sure... I might have.
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
In the car?
In the car.
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
We're not sure.
What do you think he did?
You don't really believe she's innocent?
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
It has.  How's business?
Good.  And how are you?
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
He's gone, hasn't he?
No.  He's - no.
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
Why special?
I've never seen you in here before.
That's because I've never been here before.
It must end here... or I am the future.
Say, Bill...
You really think Sheldon's out there?
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
I have.
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
Son! -- Out of the water now!
My boat's neat, dad!
Ben?  Ben?
Free your mind and return he will.
My mind fills with so many images.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
I see a city in the clouds.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
I need your clothes, Byers.
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Jack, wait...
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
Are you being helped, sir?
I'm looking for some perfume.
Any particular brand?
Well, it's for a woman.
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
Listen to her singing.
I'd like to begin.
Begin what?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
Would it stop you if I did?
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
You're what?
'Lo.
Kit!  Where've you been?
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
We made it!
Yes, Spock.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Going somewhere?
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
I've really got to --
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
Looks like business is booming.
Who said they left then?
Who left -- where?
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.
Closin' down, sir.
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
What?
I asked if you felt like a drink--
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
I'm Admiral Kirk...
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
Lower.
Lower.
hey.  Great show, huh?
Ninety-three miles an hour.
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
No baby, you got it wrong.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Sir, please try to hold still.
What about them?
I know a shortcut.
Shortcut?
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
I have no claim, Thomas.
But you won't sign, correct?
Correct.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
Bastard.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
You can't do that.
Don't tell me I can't --
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
It must be great.
Hey!
First time for everything.
Something's haywire,
What do you mean?
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
Wait as long as you like.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
Fundamentals?
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
No, I do not have any of those.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
1952...?
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
But Charlene...
When worlds collide.
Huh?
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
The missing scientists.
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
A simple yes or no would have done.
Want me to lead?
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
Water or mineral deposits.
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Mef?  What's Mef?
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
Do you want more rice?
Maybe later.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Aren't you a little early?
Those yours too?
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
What'd you put him in there for?
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
She won't even see me, Pitts.
What?
Smile.
Smile... good?
Is he out?
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
How did he expect to do that?
Sorry.
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
I didn't use my name.
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
We don't need the tapes --
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
You, too, golden rod.
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Well, why does it?
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
Yo.
How are we doing?
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
Can you take me to it?
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
On three?  You call it.
Danny?!  Danny!
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
To all those cons...
Searching for a money man...
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
-- till he fucked his parole --
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
Yes, me!
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Jack!
We're leaving.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
You lied to me!
What?
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
She's mistaken.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
Why would she lie?
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
What are you guys gonna do?
It is?
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Father Perrault is dead.
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Yes.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
Do it?
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
What...?  What if I say no?
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
Why me?
Oh --
...Oh, did that hurt?
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
How did you know?
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
So... I see you made the news.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Out getting coffee.
... And then some.
Good God.
- you who don't have a conscience.
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
No.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
No.
Are you a writer too?
No, I'm an actor.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Anything I'd know?
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
What?
It's so beautiful!
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
The agents --
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
What do you know?
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
Morpheus, I don't know --
What?
Look ! Look !
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
Used?
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
Took what?
And... what does Jeanne think?
Louise?
Go, Chief.
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
I know the one.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Guaranteed, eh?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
Where did you get this gun?
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Don't lie to me.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
No!
Oh God, Lins... I--
I want to stay.
A shark fin?
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Big?
Yes.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
I'm sorry.
You listening to me?
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
Two...
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
How did you settle on the amount?
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
Yes.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
How long have you been doing this?
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
This is my way of telling you --
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
And the moral of that story is -- ?
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
Wadda you so sore about?
What do you mean?
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Stop picking on him.
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Regarding what?
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
I know.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
What do you think?
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...
You knew her?
What?
Any more ...
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
I'm here.
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
We could get back together too.
Fuck.
What do you think?
Well! Come on!
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
Yes, I will.
Hi.  Hi.
My reputation precedes me.
Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
I was the kids' godfather.
And...?
"And" what?
How you doing Buddy?
Is that...permanent?
I...I don't know...
Help me.
How can I?
And good morning.
Good morning.
Nice spot.
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
But you did promise.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
Yes, I suppose so.
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Put a tap on her phone.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Well.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
-- It's for you, Ike.
What?
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
Er, I knew you looked different.
Remember how they used to stick out?
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
What am I gonna eat?
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
What do you think?
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Elliot!
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
You're out looking here?
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Ohhhh!
How about you?
Oh.  Well, I live--
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Where are you headed?
No good.
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
There she is!
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
How fast does that go?
It goes very fast.
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
... A piece of paper ...
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
Is Jean Michel here?
What's the matter?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
Are you comfortable with this?
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
But why attack an Agent?
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
Oh. Goodness.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
Like what?
But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
God, there's Lester...
Don't go, Jackie...
I can't just let him stand by the door...
Don't leave me...
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
What for?
Holy shit...
Justin?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
Maybe... why do you ask?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
Why?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
Yes, but... I thought...
What?
That you were just indulging me.
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
...  maybe three hours.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
What?
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
What happened to them?
A long, long, long, long, while.
Okay, okay.
A long, long, long...
What?
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
Really?
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Sure -- I guess.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
I'm through with you.
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
What'd you wish, George?
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
Why did you do this?
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
Sheila...
Too bad.
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
It's my wife.
I'm asking you to leave.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
And put it on expenses?
That's the dope.
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
I'm listening.
I'm putting it on the top step.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
Who does?
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Wonder what?
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
She's beautiful, you know?
I'll be watching over you.
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?
I'm fine.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Is he?
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
You figured what?
Know what this is?
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Get off me!
Will you calm down?
And you?
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Grey, you read me?
What's this in favor of?
What does he want from you?
Hard to say.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
...I'm going to kiss you.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
Keaton, I can't just -
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
What if I
...What did you do with the bodies?
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
You don't remember me, do you?
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
I can't go in there.
We can measure wind.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
What do you actually know with religion?
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
You know you don't have to do this.
I'm fine, I really am.
I admire your strength.
We all have to be strong, right?
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
We're here on the sofa bed...
Charlie...
I- don't know what you're talking about!
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
Father, I'm right here.
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
Get outta here!
What the hell happened?
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
No way.
Can we just talk this out?
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
What'd he get you?
A Porsche.
Mm.
Yeah. So, what about you?
What about me? I don't have a car.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Military marching bands.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
I'd like to.
Oh, yeah?
Ow! My foot's asleep!
Get back!!
The generator!
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
I didn't say I was good at it.
Yes.
Please don't say this.
Mank-
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
Why don't you get some rest?
I've got to work.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
You're going to stay here...?
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Yeah...
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
Okay.
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
So ?
He already had a balance of $600,000.
He probably has a history of this shit.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
Yeah.
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
A long time, with one man.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Can't it wait till morning?
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Open it.
Hildy!
Can I bring some toys?
You can bring ONE toy...
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
The key!? She has the lost key!?
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Only once, at Redstone.
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
I'm just having some fun.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
Jacob, what can I do?
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
Ray...
Subject?
O'Neil, Jordan.
Thought you two were file-closed.
You knew about us?
You're too close.  Back off.
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
No way.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Do they know who did it?
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
They think it's school-related?
Did I tell you that?
I want you to trust me.
Maybe someday.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
That's hard to believe.
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
Who are you, sir?
My name is Orson Welles
The actor
And director.
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
Hey!!
You threw it at me!!
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
Ba-ll!
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
How bizarre!
The prom. That's funny.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
That'll be the day.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
Oh shit, what's today?
Today is Tuesday.  What?
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
What'd he say?
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
Boo!
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
You got plenty of money?
Sure, boss.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
But why do you want a divorce?
Because I don't love him.
What is it?
I've seen him.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
What are you talkin' about?
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
I don't believe you.
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
On their honeymoon.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
So?
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
I'm a mirror.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
That's right.
Okay?
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
I was with the Princess.
Where?
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
Go on... go on...
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
And did you?
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Oh, Andy.
Don't cry.
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
I can't.
You've got to get your mind off this.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Go!
And don't ever try to see me again.
What are you talking about?
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
Do you think I care
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Dorothy!
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
You're talking like a crazy person,
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
Were you in love with him?
I thought I was.  I was confused.
And now?
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Went out before service.
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
What museum?
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
No can do.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.
I have a duty.
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
I don't understand why you do that.
Why I do what?
That.
Why I give pennies?
Yeah. Why you give money.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
What are you talking about?
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
So.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Right.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Shut up.
It won't work --
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
And I know people.
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
I'll go with you.
No way.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
So what do you think?
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
Who used to say that?
So do I.
This going to work?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
We think we know where Betty is.
Was it great?
It was okay.
You'll always remember your first time.
It was nice.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Susan?
Yes?
Good evening, Gaston.
Who is it?
Frank.
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
Hello there, Picart.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Why are you carrying the dog?
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
When you eat him, may I have some?
No deal.
Still smells fishy.
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Is he breathing?
... babies.
You mean babies with you?
What's wrong with me?
Elaine!
Ted!
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
It most certainly is.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
Was the paralysis immediate?
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
Nearly a year.
Any attacks of pain since?
Yes, Doctor.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
help me get in the truck. 
You really had other offers?
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
...You are ze fahzer?
Something funny, Levi?
This is the group I was telling you about.
Which one is your brother?
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
I don't think so.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
Why not?
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
I don't think they believe us.
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
The pages filled in?
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
And you defending her?
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
To Misery.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
I'm not interested in him.
You're not interested in him?
No, I'm not.
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
Y-y-y-yes...
Tell us about it...
Got it.  You ever space walked?
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
It's still against the law.
What the hell is this?
Just some buddies.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Could it be Spock's?
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?
They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
And then?
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
You are?
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
1002.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
You told me what?
So...?
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
Okay.  You got the "item"?
I got the item.
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
How many?
Two main players plus three.
My end?
25% discount on the load.
Make it 40%.
Make it 35.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
You got nice tits.
Someone's gonna see us.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
What do you mean by that?
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Charlie!
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
Who's that?
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Great ass.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Yeah, I know.
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
Hello, Case.
I thought you already left.
Maybe you should be moving on.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
Get up!
Look daddy!  It's empty!
Did I kill my mother?
What??
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
You were gone for a while.
I went out to Delmar.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I saw her.
She didn't see you, in other words.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Well?
I understand.
That horrible woman!
Stop the damn car.
No way.
I said pull over.
So they'll go.
Am I suppose to be this sore?
I don't know how to walk in heels.
This is permission to take her apart.
Where is she?
Hasn't she had enough?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
This is nice.
Never been here before?
Must have opened while I was away at school.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
Sorry.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
Sounds like a rough time.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
I'm serious.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
That's what I know.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
With Hypnocyl?
That's right.
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
Just until we get things under control.
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
So do I.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
Did you hear me, sir, because --
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
No sir.
It was fun, anyhow.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
I don't know.
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
Ringo!
What a pretty tune.
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Go ahead.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Kill me and have done with it.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
Your crime... as well as mine.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
I see it before me.
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Were you in it?  In the war?
You never saw that picture, huh?
What picture?
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
All right, Mickey.
Laurie, you come with us...
Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Racist piece of shit.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
You're really in love, aren't you?
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
Hello.
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
Mama was probably asleep.
Will? Are you okay?
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
I want to see you, too.
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Come home with me.
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
What's this Mama shit?
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
What's the problem, Molly?
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Will?  You could come up here.
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
That's not true.
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
Oh, lots.
Yeah, that's right.
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
Oh, please, Mike...
Give me a break!
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
We were headed...
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
He'll not escape me.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
Where to?
Kennedy.
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
So?
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
Nervous?
Yeah.
You flew before?
Where have you been all day?
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
What?! That you had something to do with it?
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
Lucille? Where do you get that?
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
My God, what?
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
What's it to you?!
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Those sluts!
They're hungry.
He brought that up from the wreck.
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
Her job.
I want to know everything about you.
Why do you say that?
Because they are all the same.
That was all Fenster and McManus.
You're staring at me.
I wasn't star--
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
We left them eighty-eights.
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
We've got problems here.
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
What! Who?
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
Hing, hang, hung.
You better not sing that song.
Why?
Sounds good to me.
You here to see my mother?
Yeah.
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Hungry?
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
Who gives!
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
Rick?
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
Another one, eh?
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
John, where are we g --
Go on! Get out!
He doesn't care.
Good-bye, Frankie.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
Permission granted.
May I ask, where are you bound?
San Francisco.  And you?
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
And how much is braces?
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
I ordered lunch.
You ordered it here?
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
Hey, man.
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
Nice town that you've got here.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
But
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
That's good money.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
Then what?
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
That's not going to happen!
But it could happen.
Our data is being prepared.
<U>Answer</U>!
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Hey.
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
No.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
No.
Amsterdam?
No.
Constantinople?
No.
You've never been in Constantinople?
No!
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Yes!
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
But--
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
And harems ... ?
A through H is correct.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Check.
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
Me?
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
Mr. Yesil.
Excuse me, Andy...
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
Well?
Well what?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
I live here, remember?
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
What you doing here?
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Don't call me that.
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, Dil --
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
How you sound?
I won't do it anymore.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Anything wrong... ?
What's in there?
POWs.  And their families.
So I'm supposed to be ...
Compassionate.  Grateful.
Proud?
Sir?
Of them.
Yes, yes.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
For very long?
Yes, sir.
Could you come with me please?
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
But you think he fools around.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
So what are you doing with a dog?
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Sorry.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
Tons and tons.
Where is Sidney's father?
Home--where he lives.
And are the police sure about that?
Why don't you ask them?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
No, I don't.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
So you didn't do it after all.
I don't think...
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
Um-hmm.
Except for one little thing.
And what's that?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
How come you don't like me?
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
What do I got?
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
Is she dying?
She's having a baby. Twins.
Es impossible.
You can trust me on this one.
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
How did this... how did I let this happen?
You couldn't have known.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
You still believe in him.
He's a good man.
Better be. You left me for him.
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
Scottie, what are you doing?
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
They're none of them right.
What exactly you doing, John?
I'm going up to the institute.
Now?
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
So you have the answers...
Ah! You have questions?
What are we?
Nothing if not vampires...
Who made us what we are?
Surely you know the one who made you...
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
did you hear anything before he cries?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
No, nothing, sorry.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Of course.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Two weeks holiday.
How much money are you carrying with you?
I have five-hundred dollars.
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
I do need to see Starling.
Starling?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
Yes he is.
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
You get a translator, Captain?
So what did you think?
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
I have no intention of having an accident!
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
Sorry.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
I'm doing okay.
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Money?
No.  I got a problem.
Let's hear it.
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
Alright, I'll talk to her
Are you really going to kill them?
What is it?
Office of--Senator Smith?
*No*!
The man downstairs said number--
I don't want to get in trouble.
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
Uh, huh.
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
How much do you know?
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
What else did you keep out of the papers?
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
Somebody hurt him?
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
I'm home!
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
Yeah?
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
M'm.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
M'hm.
G-go on, I'm interested.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
M'hm.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
M'hm.
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Yeah.
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Sinatra?
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Yeah?
and I keep, you know, it's-
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Whatta you mean? Me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
Will it change your wife?
Will it change my life?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
Jamie --
I'm sick.
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
Don't thank me.
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
You wouldn't.
Where?
There.
Behind the rabbit?
It is the rabbit.
... You silly sod.
What?
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
Except us.
When did you deliver this first?
My, God!  What have you done to him?
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
Good to see you again.
Amy.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
You're not Baxter?
My name is Emmett.
Robert, I think you better just...
Mine, too!
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
Bobby--
It's been a few years.
Yeah.
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
I need help.
Tell me about it.
How can I reach you?
Are you okay?
Are you still in Crystal City?
What the hell is this?
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
See?  Nothing.
Nothing at all?
Complete washout.
That makes me feel just awful.
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
You mean you can't fall in love?
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
What happened?
I don't want to bore you.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Oh, no!
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Talk about sad.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
You poor, poor boy.
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
How can you think about food at a time like this?
What else is there for me? 
Is it that hopeless?
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Have you ever tried American girls?
Besides what?
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
What?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Are you guys all right?
You could've killed us.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
Spock?
I cannot go with you.
Why not?
I belong here.
I don't understand...
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
Where would you like to eat?
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
Coney Island??
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
Right.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
Is it real?
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
Leave my daughter alone.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
What do you know of my husband?
I know he left you behind.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Nine and-a-half years ago.
That's *it*?
That's it.
What is it?
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
What time is it?
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
What?
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
But nothing did.
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
What happened to your pants?
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
They'll have guns.
What?
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
I don't know...
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
I was... never satisfied.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
Some more wine?
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
What is it?
Very nice.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
What about the body you found?
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
I did all right on McCord.
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
You can't believe that.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
Of course.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
I thought we should celebrate.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Ronald?
Does this help?
Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
What could I be up to, Lula?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
That was in Vietnam.
He's the kind liked it.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
What?
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
Sick?
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
What's her problem?
Did you play ARCADE last night?
It's me.
Hold the phone!
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
I'm fine.
You're injured.
It's nothing.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
I'm not married.
Oh.
Who's this fuck?
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
You did what?
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
Do you know you were humming?
I was not.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Tonight's the night?
Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...
You're hoping to get a look at what?
The Statue of Liberty.
You put me life in danger.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
What's that?
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
I remember it made me sick.
What are you suggesting?
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
Who?
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
No.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Yeah?
Snap out of it!
I can't!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
I'll come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
But he wants me to come!
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
What?
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
What are you talking about?
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Alright.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
Show me again.
Annie!
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
What's the matter -- restless?
Yes, people make me restless.
Even women?
There aren't any women here.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
And you're all alone.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
Well... I did.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Thank God.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Oh.
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
Did you think it was so special?
You gotta think of your old age.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
Why?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Oh?
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
How was dinner?
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
This could be worse than the old series.
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
Who put you up to this?
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
That!?!
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
What you dream?
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
No.
Sugarballs?
No.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
I have a cinnamon bar.
You do?
So far, so good. Now what?
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
No, no, that one.
... He spoke of your friendship.
Yes...
He asked you not to grieve...
... Yes...
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... The needs of the few...
... Or the one.
... Spock...
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Hi Dad.
I thought that was you, up there.
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
It's too late!
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
How much?
About twenty-four thousand.
It was more than that last week.
Yeah.
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
Tell me your name.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Actually, I think that I...
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
You're a damn liar.
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
You know it.
I'll give you back the 600.
I don't want your money.
I'm wearing, Archie.
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
Please... be cool.
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
I like to watch.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
I want to tell Eve.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Yes.
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Front page?
You again.
Me still. They left you alone?
I waited for you.
Why?
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
They do it each year.
She needs help.
Don't panic.  When security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
They'll love that.
Plato, where's your father now?
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
I don't even know this woman.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
My vacation is over in a week.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Thanks.
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Hello, Daniel.
Who's he?
Why am I looking at me?
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Whys that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess theres space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
Must it?
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Aint nobody out there, Mister.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
Come on.
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
Shut up Boyd.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
See, they get the wrong idea.
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
What?
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
I did keep an eye...
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
Where?
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
Monica, what did you do?
Nothing.
I just play my own collection.
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
Where is that?
How's that?
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
We know.
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
Oh my God.
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
...Ed?
Huh?
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Yeah.
Jesus...
Adrenochrome...
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
Hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Why?
Well I don't want to do something like that.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
That's your fault not mine.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
So it's ok if I bring her.
Please don't.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
...please, I just don't want it....
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
I'm trying to be your friend.
I know.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
I'm Donald Fettes.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Mr. Gray?
Why didn't you tell me?
Your friend's all business.
Sir Gawain.
Harry... My God...
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
What are they?
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Fuck! 

Oh, shit.
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
...Shift.
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
I think...
...we can make it.
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!

Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
I don't think we have much of a choice...
...do we?
Oh, shit.
That's right.  Now,  move!


Oh, shit.
 Okay.
SHUT UP!
What we got here a crusader?
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
Is that it over there?
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
I'll take you to a game.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
Act natural.
I was afraid you'd say that.
117  CONTINUED:  
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
Ben Corbett?
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
You watch that mouth.
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
Well --
Gray killed her.
We can't be sure of that.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
How many guys they have on you?
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
I slept very well.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
May we proceed with the business?
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I'll take it. And then what?
Let's not even talk about it.
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
I know.
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
Yes.
Woody?!
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
Hey, look on the bright side --
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Well... at least now you know.
Why did you kill my mother?
Who the hell was your father?
You... you are alive.
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
Wasn't no bullet?
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
No sir.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yes sir.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
The Golden Warriors.
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
He made that quite clear, yes.
Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.
I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
Kimmy! What's the matter?
So what brings you here?
I'm looking at new cars.
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Stop it, don't move him!
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
Whattya mean?
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
So?
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
Did you know him?
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
Taken what?
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
Oh.  Ohhh?
What're you saying?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
Oh that one there, in the corner.
The one up on the third floor?
Yes.
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
Oh Jeez.
No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
I do not often think of the past.
Who is it he reminds you of?
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
What do you mean?
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
Oh, shut up.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
Well, you're a widower now...
...my... home?
Yes, John.
You did this for me?
Yes.
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
How much is there?
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
They didn't have faces.
What?
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
But, I'm here.
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Mister Rasczak ?
What is it, Rico ?
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Good for you. Go find out.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Wussup?
Wussup, Victor.
Yeah.
Pick it up!
It's your turn!
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Mmmmm.
You like people?
They're okay.
Then why'd you do it?
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
Am I gettin' the car?
What is it, Treves?
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
Hey.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
And you're a little fucking reject.
What about what that guy said?
No. But thanks.
And does he kill people?
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Get a hold of yourself.
Yeah.
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
Where the HELL did he go?
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
Hi, Louis.
... I thought it was the drug store.
Reed's gonna fix me up --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
It's a little late for me.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
The fish?
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
It works.  You should try it sometime.
I'm not usually drunk.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Really?
Carrie... stop it.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
Who from work?
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
We won't need it then.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
You first.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
So what does he want?
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
What? What's wrong?
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
I don't know what you're talking about.
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
Wouldn't bother me.
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...
You... you... YOU --
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Bob, these are all that are left.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
What's the temperature now?
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
In the room?
My friend Jack was just here.
Your dead friend Jack?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
I was dreaming again?
I would think so.
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Bring the light!
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
I was at home.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Yes.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
No.
Why don't we say we were together?
Why would we do that?
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
What about it?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
I'm doing okay, sir.
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Loud.
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
What are you going to do?
Who is the greatest man you can think of?
Ooops.
Ooops.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Gentlemen--that's nice.
Chauncey...
Hello, Eve.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Thank you, Eve.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
How is Ben feeling?
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
What's wrong?
Well?
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Mike?
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Don't call me ever again.
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
What'll they do to him?
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
I don't think so.
Thanks.
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Why?
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
No you're not.
EXCUSE ME?
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Jesus Christ!
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
You never could have kept this from me.
I was leaving.
That's probably a good idea.
Will you come with me?
I'm staying here.
What if I come back?
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
No, I'm not it.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
What do you mean?
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
So who else?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Who's that?
Whadda you care?
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Yeah --
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
Go 'head.
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
How do you know? You know her that good?
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
Yes. I want proof.
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
Well, I -
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
I am.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
Guess.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
You came back for the book? Why?
No.
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
'Kay, Mac!
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
'Kay, Mac!
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
'Kay!
No!
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
Please, just leave the car alone.
What's the point?
Not to be trapped.
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
No.
I'm going inside.
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes...
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
Thanks for everything.
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Lemme get my coat.
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
Damn, girl.
What?
I don't wanna see that.
Mr. Gittes?
Yes?
Do you know me?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Have we ever met?
Well, no.
Never?
Never.
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
I'm so sorry, honey...
I tripped over a chair.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Why?
Grace ... Grace?
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
Scully --
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
He's expecting you?
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
No, I don't --
Please, what else could it mean?
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
So what about him?
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Might be all right.
Indy?
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
She gonna be long?
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
What does she do?
She's an editor.
Mmm. An editor.
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Can't I just go with you guys?
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
He is. Usually.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
You here with Bobby?
See you.
Probably not.
You! ... You knew about this?
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
Thank you.
Aren't you ever going back?
...Not if I can help it.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
They'll mend.
Yeah.
Rita... I know what you're doing.
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
I didn't finish talking to you!
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
George --
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
What do you mean?
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
All set.
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie
Yeah?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Kay-Em!
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
Godless buffoons, all of them.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Im your new assistant.
I didnt requisition a secretary.
And where is it now?
It's not his job -- It's my job!
Bob...
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
Don't do this.
I'll lock him away for good.
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
Tyler...
What?
Gale he's got Dewey!
I know! He killed Kincaid!
I know!
Let's get out of here!
C'mon guys, settle down --
Cynthia?
What?
How much time do we have?
Not enough, what do you want?
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
Can you hold it?
I don't know.
You don't think that's crazy?
Got it.
Charged?
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And?
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
Oh yeah. Much better.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
Half for doing what?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --
Take a look at this.
What's the matter?
What?
Is there an antidote?
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
What didn't he tell you?
Didn't who tell me?
Burke.
What's Burke got to do with it?
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
Hold it, mister.
Oh, God...
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
Lucy.
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
-- a job.
That was meant for me!
You know a lot about art, I guess.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
...that's all right.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
Won't that mean you're dead?
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
Dixie McCoy didn't.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
Continue forward, sir?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
That's it, give it your best shot.
Would you watch the damn road?
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Right.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
What are you laughing at?
...may be the heat....
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
Nothing. They're still there.
What are you doing... ?
You're Starkiller?
Yes, sir.
Have you been checked out?
You dance...
Divinely?
How the hell did you do that?
Fucking chick's married.
What?
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
Yes.
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
You're walking to California?
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
...OK.
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
Where are they?
We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
Is she?
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
Jack!  It's Christmas!
Will we get another ship?
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Why?
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
When did you decide?
I'm getting married...
Shall we unpack it?
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
It's so... small.
Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
Uh -- what?
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
Go stand by the flagpole.
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
What?
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
You think she was really there?

 Shit. 
 Go on.
 Go, go.


Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!

No.  Shit.
Come on.
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay. 

Okay.
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
 Okay.  Okay. 
These'll keep it cold.
Yeah...
...yeah.
 Aw, shit  

All right, let's go.

Okay.  All right.  Okay. 

Getting anywhere with those?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
Did I?
You don't remember that?
I know it's a dream.
You do?
Aha!
Aha?
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Is this leading somewhere?
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Starting with a screw?
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Where...where am I?
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Reed? ... Sue?
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
Should I be?
Brides often are, I'm told.
You heard me!
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Sir. It's quite clear that...
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Is he oily or dry?
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
Why were you snooping in my office?
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
Did you hear that?
What?
Did you hear what he said?
What?
He made, you know, a remark.
Honey, are you okay?
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
Should I make it all fact?
What are you talking about?
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
Pheromones?
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
No.
I... I would take advantage of it.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Then tell me what happened.
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
Love at first sight?
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Back where?
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Some of 'em.
Can I open 'em up?
Sure, go ahead.
Really?
In your dreams.
Dad!
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
How do you know that?
You want it coming back with us?
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Good boy.  Where's is it?
What?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
Go ahead.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
My office.
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
I don't know you.
You think it's funny, huh?
I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
Why don t you just go for Price?
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
He's rich.
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
He has a great body
Are you all right, Dad?
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Like a tea ceremony?
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Still a bit chilly ...
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Have you any place in mind?
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
PEM115!
**?!! 
Boy, is that smart...
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
Where'd you get it then?
I stole it.
I believe you.
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Ah.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
I don't know. I can assume...
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
I'm not sure.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Video.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
How can I reach you?
My mistake. I apologize.
What made you ask such a question?
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
Why not?
Come on.
Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.
Look at this!
I'll get it back next time.
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
Carol!
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Yeah, I guess you are.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
So what's your beef, pal?
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
It was you.  Downtown.
Eh?
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
All of what?
Of the deal, man.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
And that is?
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
Then why send me back to them?!
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
That was beautiful.
I taught you that.
I can play the piano?
Shit!
Brady! Come with us.
Go!
Brady!
Was it... a rat?
Cowboy.
Girls can't be cowboys.
You're out of your mind.
He's an enemy soldier.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
I was beautiful then.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
But you would not stay with me.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
She was not as beautiful.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
We had no children.
You had a son.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Where is he? My son.
So... You're ready for me now?
You've got to help them.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
... I will.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
Jujitsu.
Same thing, isn't it?
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
What's the difference?
Where?
Just... I have to.
And I want to know where.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
Where are you going?
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
The Albacore Club.
It has to do with my father.
I know.
He owns it. You know?
I saw him.
You saw my fa... father? When?
This morning.
You didn't tell me.
No, you didn't, Bob.
Who?
Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
Who?
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
At the bottom of mines?
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
Shoes too?
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
I thought you'd missed the train.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
Is Freddie here?
He's downstairs.
Indivisible and inseparable.
Incestuous.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
Shock.
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
What do you really want?
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
You bet.
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
Sam...
These scars.  How did you get them?
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
That's great.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
What are you scared of?
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Eww. No. That's gross.
What if I say no.
Can't you open the door?!
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Would you cool it already?
I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
...yeah... good...
Was there blood?
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
Fine!
Good night, then.
Please keep it.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Did you bite it?
I don't remember.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
Hey -- those are my files --
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
Maybe.  I should call Ben.
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
And the bodies?
Black capsule.
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
What -- ?
Goodnight, Malcolm.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
Goddamnit--
--see?--
--I'm trying--
--fifteen phone calls--
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
Why didn't we get that?
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
How'd you do that?
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
What?
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
What are you saying?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
You think they sold me out? No way.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
My brother blacksmiths!
That's right.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
You're lying, aren't you?
Yeah.
Michael.
What?!
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Where?
I'm afraid it may storm.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Tis not fit for a princess.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I have no wife.
Then, perchance you'll me.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
Oh no.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
And that is?
Because it's there.
Ah, Captain?
MM.?
You are a monster, Zorg!
How's everything at the apartment?
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
I never thought he'd do it.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
I guess so.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
I got poked around... here and there.
Which brother did this?
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
I love my brothers.
No you don't.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
You never asked them about it?
Are you serious?
Not ever?
I know you.
Oh shit.  Walter.
What the fuck is going on there?
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
Easy, Dude.
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
...How's the turtle food this week?
...Fine.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
...I'm sorry.
Mommy!!!
About that chest-cutter...
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
No?
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Property.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Who is this?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
What, are you alright?
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
Well?
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Well, how much would you like?
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
I have?
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Am I what they had in mind?
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
Lets go, Jock.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
500 Kellicams!
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
Why?
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Don't talk nonsense.
He wants to kill US!
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
Good strategy.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
That's bullshit.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Yes.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
She's fine.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
Would you please go and look?
What's that, peanut?
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
Why did you?
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
'Been up north?
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
No.
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Why aren't you on board?
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
To you, sir?
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
You said we were on the same programming team.
Yes.
But I don't know anything about programming.
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
How you two doin'?
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
What's that?
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What are you then?
Is that the question of compassion or science?
It's a question.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
I think they'd understand.
No ...
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
No, and neither were my men.
Why?
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
To show them to the UN, right?
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
Peter keeps asking me out.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
I'm a junior.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Two days.
Tea.
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
What...?
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
Ahm.....
Yeah, he told me.
Personally?
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
What Get Away jet?
It was in the Herald.
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
No.
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
You're compulsive.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Why's that?
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
Oh, God...
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
I don't drink.
It's for your finger.
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
Yeah.
History, man, history. How much?
Two kilos.
Where?
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
Twenty months?
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
It's a crime.
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
No.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
Yes.
Just now...
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes.
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
I . . ..
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
I...yes.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
I...
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Yes, of course, we --
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
I won't quit !
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
Fuck him!!!
...Be gone!!
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
Oh, my God!
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
What about Maxine?
Fuck Maxine.
What, sweetheart?
No.  Why only --  Oh --
Well -- what is it?
Did you bring it with you?
I hope I'm not intruding?
Be my guest. What you got?
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
Let me check.
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
Oh, MiGod.
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
Quite touching.
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Where is the Austrian?
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
That's right.
Where is your mother?
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Louis.
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
Isn't he a little moody?
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Do Grable.
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Shut up.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
Buddy, you're just a child.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
It gets worse.
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
What?
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
Why?
Why what?
Dr STECKLER?
Yes...?
Dude!
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
Nah...
You are so completely unbalanced.
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
It still worked in town.
I mean the armchair!
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
Rachel's job is she works.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Yes...if you like big hair...
Mommy?
What honey?
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
You know, I really should take your card.
Oh my God, we're too late!
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
Yes on all counts.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
You need to get out more.
....do you know who I am?
You're a friend of the family I presume?
What?  What does that mean?
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
She didn't do it again did she?
Stupid. Stupid.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Yes?
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
You wanted to see me, Admiral?
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
Believe you're right.
Man, they're defended... no way in.
Flip six, three hole.
What ?
What, Justin, what shows you?
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
What does?
Who are you?
His name is...
You told me that part already.
What is it?
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
We have to get off this beam!
How about you? Do you want to go?
Go? Where?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
You'll wait till you rot!
Okay?
The old man's screwy!
What's 'at?
I said, the old man's screwy!
Yeah!
The dame's too smart for him.
My suitcase--
Sir?
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
Fine. You got five...
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
I found it... It's just not there.
Thank you.
For who?
Ever met Walter Winchell?
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
Let me borrow your car.
May I be blunt with you?
If you must.
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
Don't know.  That's how it works.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Right.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
What are you thinking about?
I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
What's up with you?
Nothing.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Excuse me.
What?
Is this yours? Your pen?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
Did he give any reason?
He suggested I ask you.
Ask me?
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
Will you get off my back for once?
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
You shouldn't have hit me.
You want to get into this now?
This story is big huh?
Mammoth.
Well?
Well what?
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
What's that?
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
How many lines of code are there?
Uh - - about two million.
How'd it go?
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.
Then it went well.
Did it really go well?
Define your terms.
Do you feel good about it?
No.
Do others feel that you did well?
No.
Then what was good about it?
I lost six pounds...
Aaron, will you tell me?
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
People phoned in.
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
I'm not kidding.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
Pregnant.
No, no, that's impossible.
Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
Damn!
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
The Army can hang him.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Did you get his number?
I know who it is.
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
I still don't understand --
Yes you!
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
So why this ?
Excuse me ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
Is this really the time ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
He hired you to build this place ?
Oh God.
When did it all start?
You mean my problem?
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
I don't know.
That's not a helpful answer.
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
Mookie.
What?
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
Ask Sal.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
What, um...  What do we do?
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Why do you keep saying that?
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Oh, him.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
What?
We'll cover it later.
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Where are you going?
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
What?
I'm afraid you've got to.
I'll be all right.
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
Ain't gonna be moved?
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
Or what?
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
Mitchell?
What do you do?
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
It's still a little early for me.
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Four bits.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
I try not to expect you.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
Not much point to this, is there?
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Mm.
When's the arraignment?
The first two murders.
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
He told me he had done two others just like it.
When was that?
When he was seventeen.
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
What's this?
What if you don't make it?
I'll make it.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
No it's not.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Anything I can help you with?
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
Sixteen times.
But I
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
Yeah, I guess.
Yes, Cole?
It's a fait accompli?
Done.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I don't know.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Yes.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
Calvin?!
Right here!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Why?
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
It works a little.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
You do?
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
What took you so long?
Kill him! He's the one!!
Thank you ...
... that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
What?  Jesus, tell me!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Steering wheel...
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
Oh... um, William.
Welcome to the club.
Excuse me?
I hear youre looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leons gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
Uh-huh.
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
I take it you dont know where he is, then?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you?
I know his work better than I know him.
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just aint worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of em.
What about his girlfriend?
What about which girlfriend?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Would you know where I might reach her?
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I dont really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. Thats how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
Could that be Camden Market?
Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
Is Spanky here?
No, but...
Then what's the problem?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Yeah...
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Sharp.
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Like what?
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
I'm stayin', Homer.
What?
That light.
You've got something to show me.
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
I'll stay here and secure this position.
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
Anything harder?
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
What you see is what I got, mister.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
What'd ya got there?
Keys.
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Huh?
Open up the trunk.
Yes.
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
Oh, yes.
Will I be seeing you again?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Oh. That. Rome.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Without any clothes on?
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, but...
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Yes.
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
So you didn't go to school together.
No.
And you didn't come up here to see her.
No.
You were lying.
Yes, I was lying.
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
I wrote the letter.
What did it say?
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
But you tore it up.
Yes.
Why?
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I told you what happened in Rome!
Do you expect me to believe...?
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
How about I go right, sir?
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Fucking Danny, man...
CQ what?
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
Tank.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
We need an exit.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Where is the ring?
Someone else has it now.
That would indicate that it's the future.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
What do you know about it?
As much as ever.  Nothing.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
The hospital.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
...Yes potatoes... but...
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
Yes, probably... maybe...
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Yes, but...
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
No, I... I held it up to...
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
--now c'mon!
Those yours too?
How much?
I think two million.
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
I need you to stake me.
Stake you?
What now?!
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
She's here, your wounded one.
What are you saying?
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
Huh?
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
You don't think we're going to make it.
I didn't say that.
You didn't have to.........
I just need you to be safe.
What about you?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
What is it?
It's a thought I had.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
Check!
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
So what do you make of it?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
He's a riot.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
Stop it!
There's more.
Just stop.
Just giving the facts.
I'm calling the police.
I'm just practicing my lying.
Still needs work.
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Sandra Sinclair.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
Why'd you ask him.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
...things change.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
Do you want more children, Willa?
I -- no, I --
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
Dudley.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
Dudley's guys.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
That's so weak.
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
I see.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Yes. It's a very good show.
Mom?
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Nashville.
Oh... Well.
The car broke down.
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
Next you'll be sick.
I feel really good.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
I don't know his first name.
Bet the sheets are grey.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
Fungus?
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
I don't think so.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
That's it?
Care to join me?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Yes.
No way! She's pretty.
You sound shocked or something.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
I wouldn't know.
Surely --
What I do, I do for my Queen.
Was there never ambition?
Maybe, once.
Then I envy yo.
Why?
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
I do what I do.
For Her Majesty.
Aye.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
I said.  I serve the Queen.
Isn't it?
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
None.  Christ!
You're not even coming?
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
Wait a minute-
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
That's the last thing they took from me.
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
I likes yellow.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
You saying nothing counts?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Not like He punished me.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Was a time I knew what was.
You still know.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
I am really sorry about this.
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
What?
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
He is the Destructor.
Wow.
Time?
Between six and seven seconds.
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Hey, how you doin'? 
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
What happened to "degrees"?
I didn't kill him --
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Sure. Any time.
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
I wouldn't do that, son.
How do you figure that's your bunk?
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
It's been about a year.
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
It was one incident.
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
Got a family back there?
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
What's your father do?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
Into what?
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
I love her.
No shit?
Does anyone want another?
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
A third party?
What's all this dirt in the yard?
What do you want?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Not yet.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Can't it go to any office?
Monsters in the gelatin...
It's a roach, guy --
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
What's ya name again?
Bob.
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
What are you gonna talk about?
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
Then why are you putting on mascara?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Congratulations. You passed the test.
What do you mean?
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
Another drink please.
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
It's good with coffee.
Just goes to show you.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
What?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
Six years ...
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
No sign of the snowman.
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
What are you doing here?
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
We'll take it!
Benjie!
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Certain?
Range is two kay.
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Huh uh.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
What if I keep dropping?
Not an option.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
I don't believe you.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
But what am I going to do?
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
I'm sorry, Bill --
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Then what is it?
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
Which is what?
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
So that's what love is?
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Those were my words, Bill.
You look very pretty.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
You're mad, aren't you?
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
The United Nations are still here.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
What did you overhear?
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
What did they say?
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Well, do we just go on up?!
Right!
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
He gives a good report and I walk?
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
Often, uh.
How recently?
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
It's November.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
What about this Beetle guy?
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Who are you?  IRA?
Herr Salieri.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
But he's all right?
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Of course.
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
Bene.
I'll call tomorrow.
I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed.
What? Ah yes. Of course. I'm sorry. It's just that...you're my idol.  And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
For my hair?
Have you got to tell her your life story?
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Did you like the first act?
Yeah. What about the second act?
You're kidding, really?
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
Talk so I can understand.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
Bobby?
Yeah.
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
What do you mean?
Who did you work with to get the--
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
Have you been working with Rachel?
No.
Sorry.
Mm. Better.
Did you need it?
Yeah.
Yes, but...
You are, aren't you?
Certainly, but...
That should make her happy.
Who's she?
Go ahead. You can say it.
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
How do you know?
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
We got word from Chicago.  They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.
What about the other one?
They're still looking for him.
Who's got the contract?
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Hackers.
Sakwa!
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Why?
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.
What's the assignment?
You think?
Jesus Christ!
Why don't you come back with me?
You ok?
FINE. Are you?
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
What?
Mark invited me to the party.
What party?
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
How long?
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Nope. No complaints.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Must be the Spring.
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
No. No. It's too good a story.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Yeah?
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Um. You're doing all right.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Santa Claus?
KingKing Westley was in it.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Thanks, professor.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
Where're we going?
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
My self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
So now you're -- ?
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
No. I mean work work.
Well, what can you do?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Extra?
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
I don't want you for a friend.
Why not?
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
Up I would say... What would you say?
Up.
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
You hate Raoul?
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
So. What should I do now?
Yes, I have. I will.
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
I guess not.
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
What do you mean?
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
I don't want to go back.
What do you want to do?
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
Here...  Here...
What is it?
You're going to live here permanently?
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
Yes, Gaston?
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Call the police?
Instantly.
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
Karen? You okay?
I want to know about Exley.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
You're twenty-three years old!
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
We didn't have sex.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
You're rationalizing.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were in the m- You were in the building.
Here's your class.
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
Not too far, I hope.
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
Leaving the room.
Leaving the room ... yes.
Yeah, where we going?
That "thing" gets me excited.
The things that get you excited.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
What are those mirrors for?
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
What do you mean?
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
The what?
The City Sealer's office!
You mean here in the city?
Argo!  Hobbes!
That poor woman.
Ryan's really angry with me.
I think he's really angry with me too.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
I'm sorry.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
That's a lot of those.
Medallions.
A lot of cakes.
Yes.
And he doesn't smoke?
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
How long have you been married?
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
You must have been a baby.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
Really?
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
Describe him.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
The shooter local?
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Not as bad as it looks.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
So you're a writer?
Trying to be.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
If there was, I didn't see it...
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Right.
I just hope this is still good up there.
I'm back, Mama.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
My error.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Well, nothing.
Now what?
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
But you said we could be together.
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
But I want to say with you,
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
I've been waiting for you to get back.
You got something on the coke?
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
What do you want from me?
What?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Do you still have friends on the force?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
What makes you think I could do that?
You were a cop.
What makes you think I would do that?
I'm your son.
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Why the fuck not?
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
What was that?
Oh nothing.
Tell me.
No. It is too judgmental.
Tell me what he said.
Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
Why not?
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Guess I'm just lucky.
No further questions.
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Winning?
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
The situation has changed.
That so?
Do you own a video camera?
Yes.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Yes.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
What happens now?
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
I wonder how he did it?
Did what?
You can't sell this to your friends.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
There is.
Even your play.
Oh
And that was only my first try.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
I think he's dead!
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
We had a description of the suspect.
Are you warm, Captain?
Is it a king or a queen?
It's a double.
Even better.
Even cosier.
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in.
You really think that's what happened?
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
Why?
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Did Sidney tell you about it?
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
C'mon, Tommy --
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Never felt better.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
He should.
...Okay.
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Why not go to work for me?
Doing what?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
Yes.
She took the baby in her arms?
Yes.
You saw it all didn't you?
Yes.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
We could...
Armed robber.
So you do fantasize?
Yes.
About who?
I fantasized about you.
About me?
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
Epps? You there?
Ray. X22.
I read, Cooch.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
Good.
Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
We gonna fuck or what?
Right there.
How was America?
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
...nightmare.
What's up...?
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
Yeah, so where is he?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
They got that kind of money?
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
Hello.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this  believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I  I'm sorry - listen, how are you  I'm sorry. You doing okay?
...Who is this?
What are you up to, Nicole?
Nothing.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
[Do you know who I am?]
[Who are you?]
Why me...?
Why not you?
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
It is a favor, isn't it?
Your equipment has crapped out again....
Do you really mean it?
I'm glad you're here.
You are?
What are you doing?
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
I'd love it!
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
I don't have any idea.
...Need a hand with those bags?
I'm sorry.
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
I'm sorry.
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
Well?
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
What the hell is that?
Big king, too bad...
Just wait till you hear...
Hear what?
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
When?
Yesterday...
Who told you that?
...But that won't last.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
How would you describe him?
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
Sugar?
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
I know how he found me.
It's called a transponder.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
Not that way.
Not any way.
Took me about three hours.
I been immobile.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
Have what?
Did she tell you anything?
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
I wonder where he's going now?
I don't know.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?
I leave it to you.
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Twinky?
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
A wig?
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
Just want to say good luck.
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
Leave me alone, Jude.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
I heard.
Eddie and Tinker died.
I know.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
What's wrong?
Oh my Lord!
But how can you say that?
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
So am I.
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
Who?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
You are despicable.
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
She's beautiful.
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
Tha's your problem.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Huh?
Lauren?
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
House 25. Number's on the door.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Two and a half cents.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
Kinda money, huh?
Of course I recognised him!
You did?
This your stuff?
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
Um-huh.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
I'm glad.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I don't follow you.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
Okay...
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
I think so.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
What was that?
Transference!
Transference.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
If you want.
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
And white.
Easy black boy.
Gabe!
Are you okay?
This?
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
What about?
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.
Apple core?
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
No ... just keep him in here.
Until you, or anyone else ...
No, not anyone else - just me.
Hello.
Mrs. Robinson?
Yes?
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
It must have slipped my mind.
Your mind is so slippery.
You sure...?
...your ducts?
What about Betelgeuse?
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
I know.
You know.
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Tell me again.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
I don't understand.
Daphne...
Yes, Osgood?
You're leading again.
Doc it's Janet.
What's up?
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
He's doing the interview with the lady --
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
What happend?
It was illegal, what he did.
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
One that looks nice.
Of course.
And not too expensive.
Yes ...
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
Oh God.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
Why the beach?
Yes.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
Yes.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
You want something off the B list?
Damn it!  God-damn it...
Not exactly according to plan.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
But you hate each other!
And my compliments to you...
Screw sleep!
Admiring your handiwork?
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
You're not the Mayor.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
What are you doin' now?
What's the matter?
And it's over...?
Yes.
Well, then what are you doing here?
I... do you want me to leave?
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
I...
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Who told you that?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
And what makes you so tough?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...
If I don't 'grow up...'
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
You, you don't under...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
It's over!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What is that to you...?
I don't like this, this...
What just happened?
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
I'm okay.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
You damn well thought wrong.
What's wrong.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Go to the bathroom.
How many is that?
Four.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
We're on the move.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
His girlfriend?
Yes, his girlfriend.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
Yeah.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
No. She's probably scared to death.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Maybe.
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
No.
We can call our ambassador.
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
There is only three of us here.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
That's alright... I understand.
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
You know I saw you on the street.
Where?
What are you getting at?
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
What's going on, Glenn?
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
And is Foley a part of this?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Why's that?
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Gee, I wonder why not.
I'm freezing my ass off.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Really?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
Is it okay if I drink this?
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
No! Let go, Snorri!
I've got you!
You'll be sucked down too!
That's my leg.
I know what it is.
We're just talking about the...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
What are you two talking about?
Got a shovel?
No.
There's probably one in the basement.
"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
gives her a sympathetic look.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
looks startled at the outburst.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Wow!  Does this pole still work?
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
I'm all finished.  Now what?
Is it an ongoing case?
For months... last October.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
How do you know that?
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Shoot.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Oh yeah?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Jeffrey!!
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Yeah.
Jeffrey? Why?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
You like mysteries that much?
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
What is this place, Merlin?
What kind of photographs?
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
You're certifiable.
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
"Hell!"
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
It's unbelievable.
Think of it! In times like these.
Say, what about that gold deal?
Huh?
Gold. You were going to
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
An unmarked police car.
How do you know?
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
Uh-huh.
You're a deep one.
You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
I want the rest of the pictures.
What pictures?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
I heard it was an accident.
You're late.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Why are the shutters closed?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Bunch of savages in this town.
That's what I said.
... Shoelaces?
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
She's not a...
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
No way! He just called him a dick.
It's okay. I want the rush.
Shut up, before you lose them all!
What's going on?
What happened?
You don't remember?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
You've been out for about a day.
Say what?
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
Up yours.
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
I feel sure of it.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Her own father...?
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
What kind of trouble -- ?
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
And you got some Italians -- ?
Six or seven...
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
I want Fruit Loops!
Eat Cheerios.
I was just hanging around.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
To where?
Go on.
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
You shouldn't play this game.
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
How long 'till we can eject?
We're going to have to reconfigure.
How long?
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
Mmm...
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
You're so gross.
She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
Ha ha...
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
Sorry, am I interrupting?
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
Happy for him.  And relieved.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
Understood.

Not with the Romulans.

Just lucky, Admiral.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
I know how Chase really died.
What are you talking about?
Fred Krueger did it.
So... you just moved here?
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
Goodbye.
I don't feel anything.
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
What name?
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Why?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Why?
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
Please let me go with you.
No.
How ya doin', Pete?
Okay.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
The what?
Daddy!
Zuzu  Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
I don't think your gun's loaded...
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
We need to talk.
Okay sure. What about?
Had you.
No you didn't.
Wait a minute.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
Wait a minute.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
Do they have pressure?
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
She didn't write to me, did she.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
It makes us human ...
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
You're not a failure, Dick.
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
I beg your pardon?
Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave.
No way... GET OUT!!!
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
No, that's true.
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
Otis!  No barking!
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
What are you working on?
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
Hey, are you awake?
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Jesus, I don't believe it.
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
There is no news big enough.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
Do you have to be so brutal?
Yes
Why? Do you enjoy it?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
Hello.
Oh, why are you making those faces?
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Do you believe me?
Yeah, I do.
I want to believe you, too.
Okay, friend. Start running.
Just gimme a chance.
What the hell did this?
Hello?  Anybody there?
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
And after that?
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
I knew this was going to happen.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
Alright, it's done.
You see the bullet?
Clearly.
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
What do I do?
I forgot where I put my keys.
Mommy...Mommy?
Yeah...?
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
What does he look like?
You might be disappointed.
Why?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
No.
... Push me back in the water...
I can't.
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
And the other one -- he is like you?
He's captured Non!
Who is she?
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
Who is it raped you?
Nobody.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
Really.
I mean, romantically.
She is not a child.
Can I see your hands?
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
We're doing this together. We're partners.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
Honey?
You were up late last night, Brother.
Well, a little.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
Im sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
You're going to talk to him now.
Yes.
Will you tell him?
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
What am I doing here?
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
Who?
What is that?
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
And people are actually fooled by that?
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
It's not real...  That's not me.
Oh, please--
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Stacy--
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...
<u>Pay</u> her.
I don't got the money.
Find the money.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
Ouch!
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
What for?
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Why... 
Yes?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Yes.
How do you know Annie?
We... we went to school together. College.
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
Oh, no you don't!
You're hitting on me?
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
So everything you just said --
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
Yes?
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
No. I am a "tubab."
What do you mean?
What period?
Suez.  1956.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
All right.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
What about the Cromwells?
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
No... She's fine. Back home.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Sire!  I -- How did you --
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
... Nothing.
Oh, hell...
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
Maria?
Yes, the little Russian girl.
What's she got to do with it?
I was driven out.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
How can you know this?
Action?
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
TATUM!
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
Where do you want to go?
Sammy's?
He still having parties?
I've got another story.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Billion.
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
Who knows what that is?
A Jewish prayer.
Shall we go to my office?
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
How?
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Yes; John's bad.
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
Putty? On both doors?
I can't allow that, Sonny...
Hey, don't I get an encore?
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Theramin.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
But what if Sarris survives?
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
It's got to be stopped!
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
So you do drink?
Socially... I'll have a beer.
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
Sorry about that.
Shall I leave?
Could have happened to anybody.
First Nagasaki--now this.
They're gonna be what?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
We took a walk three days ago.
That was pretty cold, dude.
Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
That's unkind.
There's a satellite call for you.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee?  He liked her though he did, his mom, Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died. She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
A few people.
Did anyone stand out?
What do you mean, stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Why do you need a chain like that?
Maybe we should go in a different room?
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
Should be here any minute.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
But --
It's much safer in there, sweety.
You wouldn't have done that?
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
I want them arrested and hanged!
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
This is no game.
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
I don't know.
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
The Dancing Dingus!
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
I want to talk to Jimmy.
He heard.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
Exactly.  So... logically ...
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
I wouldn't -
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
Am I missing something here?
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
He was?
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
What --
I don't understand what we're doing.
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
Truly - uh - splendid.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
Uh-huh.
Star.
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
This could go on for hours.
So you're staying in tonight?
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
Come back tomorrow.
I'll wait for him.
What did he say?
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
So, are you having fun yet?
Yeah...a lot.
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
You don't know him?
It's almost like flying.
What about the trees?
What do you think she wants?
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
I no from around here.
What's next?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
It's not going to hold your weight.
... third Bay Area woman has been strangled, but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes, unless new evidence...
What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
You killed him...
It's gonna be o.k.
She's got guards with her.
What guy?
He was your friend.
Hi mom.
Robert...?
What are you doing here?
You've got a call.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Few have survived it.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Bullshit.
Look in my pack.
Why?
You look like you could still be in high school.
You mean that?
Mr... Mr. Hand.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
He's having an early night.
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Carrie.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Wait here.
Yes?
Are you Herr Mozart?
That's right.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
What?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
... What's going on?
And loving him means loving all of this.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
Let me rephrase that...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
Ma, Tiny's in.
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
I will be with thee straight.
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
This play?
The Red Dragon.
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
So, we're talking money laundering...
Maroon uniforms?
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
Yes it does.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
I can't win with you.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
I do not.
Lighten up.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
She fucked you?
She fucked me.
She fucked me too.
She fucked you?
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Of course.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, man, did you--
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Dont they have a limit at those machines?
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
All right, I owe you one Marv.
I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
No -- not this time.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
-- Listen to me --
My hat is off to you, sir.
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
I missed you, Lieutenant.
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
What were you dreaming about?
A voice ...
That spoke to you?
That called ... commanded ...
That wasn't very scary.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
I am an expert!
You're a teacher.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
Their people?
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
They were yellow!
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
It was you!  I thought I heard...
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
I never heard of him.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
Is she not here?
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
That's all right, really, thank you.
It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
What did it say?
A thousand things.
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
What can we do against them?
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
Everything OK?
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
I need to talk to you.
Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.
Why call me?
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
Money?
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
I love those doors.
Where will you live?
The garage.
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
When's school over?
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
What's going on here?
They're gaining on us!
We proceed assuming she is.
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
Doesn't he live here?
No, he doesn't.
Are you sure?
You saw the ad in the Times?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
So?  So?
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
This is Betty at twelve.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
I know this part, keep reading.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
Just her name.
You're just stalling now.
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
Anything?
Jamie, what happened?
It was the nightmare man
What?
So -- you've laid the ghost.
I believe I have.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
No, don't think I do.
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
You alright?  Y'okay?
Yeah.  No, not really.
Let's work it.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
He records himself raping and killing her--
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
So've I.  Too much.
But this is a bad one.
Top ten.
Let's get him out of here...
Finish the job...
And now...
He's smiling.
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Really.
Yes.
Really? That's where we're from.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
You scored with two chicks?!
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
McCord? ...
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
Excuse me, but...
May I use your telephone?
Certainly. Right over there.
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
What do you chant?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
I don't remember saying yes.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
You wouldn't announce it?
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
Right, partner.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Get out of the way.
Are you crazy?
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
WHY?
Is that the one who died?
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
Is that what you think?
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
...why do you think?
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
I will not fight you.
That's not good enough.
Christ, what...
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
Jack, you're wrong.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
What is it my son?
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
I think so... They're just... So ...
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
What is it?
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
You aren't angry with me?
I'm looking for Sid.
So?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Why'd he do it?
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay. 
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
I will.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
I'll miss you, Mike.
Show me.
Here?
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
Sorry for what?
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
You feelin' sick?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
So how's business?
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
But don't you stay in El Paso?
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
You shit!
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
They've never done a robbery?
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Okay.
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
How many more?
Just him, sir!
No, you can't die of insomnia.
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
You need to lighten up.
Can't you give me something?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Hes sealed himself in.
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Do something!
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
What's this?
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
What's the matter?
Latitude 47 degrees.
Hey.
Hey.
You got a dog?
You are?
Yeah.
Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Luther was part of the gang?
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
Stop that!
Hi.
What does he say?
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
What about ID's?
Graham.
What are you --
What could have possessed that girl!
Satan.
Shee-it...  Kee-rist, you really know the ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
Are you Detective Williams?
Yes.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
You did? A human ear?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
Let me talk to him.
No.
How much do you weigh?
...by you?
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Nor did you, I noticed.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
Exactly.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
Dave - !
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
That's what gives me The Fear.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
Not much. Why?
I have to go.
GO?
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
Can we make it?
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
I want to leave fast.
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
How did I look?
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Could you do somethin' for me?
God bless you!
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
You cold?
Freezing.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
Well?
Who are you?  Do you have a job?
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
And now you wanta teach me?
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
I doubt that.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
This your current address?
Master, Bruce?
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
You have to wash them.
Please don't hurt him.
That all depends on you.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
I will not have this in my home.
I just want to understand--
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
I don't want you to--
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
You're practically naked!
Michael, give us a lift.
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
You sure this goes somewhere?
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
Would you leave now, please?
No.  Follow him.
He'll turn around.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I don't know.  That's the point.
Will you take me with you?
Help me with this thing!
It's not the gas, Dad!
Good morning.
Is it a good morning?
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
You and I should work together.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
Burke them?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
I come from Lisbon.
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
You scared the hell out of me.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Dick-weed.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
Where is your home, Anya?
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
But chickens?
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
Leeloo... is... she's...
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
I don't agree with you.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
You would.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
You better start making sense!
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
Dreams?
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
I don't snore.
You do - repeatedly.
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
I'm very aware of that.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
It's gone.
Machines do not EAT message.
Look, I...
Jeff you have company!
Like little children.  You okay?
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Excuse me?
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
Who's Principal Collins?
The principal.
You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Does that hurt?
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Nine seconds.
Eleven and a half.
Who told you that?
My dad.
It works?
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
What the fuck you talking about, man?
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
-- Oh yeah.
What did you do to him?
When did this start?
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
Where's he gone?
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
He has a computer?
Sure.
In the house?
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
May I please be excused?
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
My God.
Not bad, huh?
You're a... you're sick.
She's awake.
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
So you do eat pussy!
Naw naw!
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
No.
Huh?
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Dead and gone.
Let's do it.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
Probably no longer than four weeks.
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Allow me.
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Eight o'clock?
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
What?
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
I have some friends who have had a accident--
You have somebody else out there?
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
I think you mean that.
Do you think I was faking?
What happened?
We never met. That's why.
You're back.
Yeah.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Sure. Why not.
Where? Where is he?
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
You talk to him?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
What hospital is he in? Where?
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[What is his name?]
[Daniel.]
You heading to the train station?
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
What was your weakness, sir?
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
Suspect Zero?
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
So you went underground?
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
I don't carry it with me.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
Put your gun down!!
Don't do this... please...
Nick!
Give us a break...
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
You mean the time you're locked away?
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
I'm sorry, Walter.
Thank you.
Is this your new dress suit?
Yes, Swana.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Yes, Swana, you did.
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Yes, Swana.
Am I interrupting?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
Where did Craig move to?
It's nice to see you.
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
No!  I'm sick of this...
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
What about your shoulder?
Where's Dad?
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Woah, watch it!
DON'T!!!
Uh oh...
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
...I dropped it.
In the tar??
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
Arch light.
Are you leaving us?
Your place?
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
I wouldn't bet on that.
That's deep --
-- Your act only works with an audience.
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
And what am I?
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
27   CONTINUED:
We split 50-50?
Not likely, convict.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
Take it easy, Jake.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
You sure you wanna go there?
Uh...maybe?
Go away. I might hurt you.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Peter I love you too but...
Which direction?
That way.
Any particular reason?
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
I'm going with you.
Not on that leg.
Take the gun.
Which way?
Why?
Who are you, kid?
But -- but --
Shut up.
John . . .?
We'd need charges.
He'll kill us.
Maybe they're Mary's.
Where'd the damn truck go?!
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Okay, Mom.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
No. I'm just a snoop.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
No, not for that one.
No, I didn't.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
Yes.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
What do you want ?
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
You busted me.
Are you following me?
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
I know, I'm sorry.
He's *paralyzed*!
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
What is it?
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
So wadda you do with your girls?
Just chill.
That's it?
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
Yeah, we better.
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
It's okay. We broke up.
When?
When did you decide all this?
Few days ago.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
Whataya mean, no record?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
I'm worried about you.
About me?  How sweet.
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
Oh, please!
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
He'll never do it.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
No way!
You know I need to use you.
To what?  Trap him?
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
I haven't seen him in two years.
Six, huh?
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
What was he after?
You have to tell us now.
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
I also saw the girl give you this.
Donkey raping shit eater.
My name is Calloway.
Martins.
You a friend of Lime's?
Yes.
Been here long?
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Relax, Baxter.
Wait... what the hell is this...
Could you fill me in?
Can you walk?
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
What are you doing here?
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
In a village called Domremy.
How old are you?
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Were you baptized?
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
Your words, not mine...
Wham... .
How do you like it?
It's quite  nice.
How about another one?
No thanks... .
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
Come on, we're next.
What?
Why'd you do that?
I don't want to hear it.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Please don't go there.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
At church?
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
You gonna sing me somethin'?
When? Now? Oh. No.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
Proceed.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Which one?
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Any planets?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Any of 'em any good?
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
Something awful happened last night.
What do you mean?!
I... I don't think you want to know.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Does your mother know?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Why didn't you do something?
I don't know.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
Well... not exactly.
He made you give him a blow job.
No.
Her fucking head was caved in.
So I didn't fucking do it!
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
We have just folded space from Ix...
Yes?... How was your journey?
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
Stick up?
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
Where.
Circle?
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
I love you, Carmen.
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
Sorry to disappoint you...
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Is he going to be okay?
Re-configure the leads?
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
Yes.
I...
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
Yo, Traxler.
Huh.
What... what are you doing?
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
The park dude was missing an arm.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
You have a right to be angry.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Like Custer huh?
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
Can there be some mistake?
Lord Almighty.
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
I don't know.
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
What night?
Last time I saw you.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Whatiya mean?
You WILL go out there.
I won't and nothing you say-
"The show must go on."
Benny, God, take it easy...
No cigar.
Yes.
Is there a phone booth there?
They all have one...
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
You will respect the law.
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
But who is left?
This your present address?
Yes.
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
Did you know the victim?
No.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
It doesn't.
Its the past. Its nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
Mind if I smoke a jay?
I told you not to -
So what?
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
You did?
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Over a girl?
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
No, I don't.
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Where?
Here.
In the knee?
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
That's terrible.
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
I don't think so--
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
Methuselah Syndrome.
What's that?
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Is that why you're still here?
Hey, how ya doin'?
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
What are they?
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
Yes, I gathered as much.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
Yes.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
Joey...
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
Joey...
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
Put them all together and what do we have?
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
What is it?
I want to go!
Where?
I want to go back to Vienna.
Now?
Yes!
Why?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Where's the medicine?
Rod!
You're being unfair.
Unfair?!
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
Oh, I see.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
A flower...
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Yes. I would like to do that.
Michael!  This thing working?
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
The first day.
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
Buy me out?...
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I hate both parties.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
Relax.
We should slow down.
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
He knows our defenses.
--or someone--
What'd you shoot her with?
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
We agree.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
Okay  all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.
And you've got one.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
So what's your angle?
Sorry.  Trade secret.
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --
We need more dog food --
Our group is full.
Much less go outside.
I heard what happened.
Hi everybody.
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
Relax.
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
I know it was bad.
It'd cost you.
Of course.  How much?
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Mr. Parker.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
They gotta go.
How many?
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
How will he eat?
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
No bones?
That's it?
Yeah.
Well, let's go.
I'll make the arrangements.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Next to "boring," "Sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current English language. I thought if I could reverse the meaning of "sucks" so it means something positive, I don't know...It would be vaguely revolutionary. It's kind of my social experiment for the summer. "Suck" is historically a nice word-- sno-cones, your mother's...
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
Yeah.
How long have you known her?
About six months.
You like her?
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
No, no. I did.
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
Yeah.
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
Yeah?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
You were talking about the promotion --
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
Yeah.
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
Yeah.
You see?
Yeah, no, I see --
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
....yeah....
So that was your pudding?
....No....
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
No I didn't say that.
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
You're giving me the creeps.
Am I dead or not?
I'm almost ready -
Are you apprehensive?
Why should I be?
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
I'm sorry.
I don't see any.
Funny.
What's going on?
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
Who's your friend?
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
Real courage. That's what we want.
Hello.
Hi. I brought some wine.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors!
Yeah.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
Not in years.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Why?
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Hi.
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
No, We aren't going to do it.
How's your love life, Midge?
That's following a train of thought.
Well?
Normal.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Three whole weeks.
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Could be.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
Sorry, old man. Work.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
What.
My... the acrophobia.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
I think I can lick it.
How?
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
My parents were divorced.
Hello?
Hello, is this Elaine?
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Where are you?
So, what's this about, Dick?
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
I'd wish for a puppy.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
I only want one.
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Claire?
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
For how long?
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
I don't want them here overnight.
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
What about your toe?
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
Did it hurt?
What did you do with it?
With what?
The ten dollars.
Oh, ten dollars
Yes.
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
Let's drop it.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
Benjamin?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Yes.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
I wouldn't know.
Well, I'm not.
You're not.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
I see.
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
Help!
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
I think you'd better go.
Ever had a romance with a crook?
I beg your pardon!
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
There goes the neighborhood.
This is horse?
Who's that?
Hello? Hello?
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
Yes...
Will you come to him on your knees?
Yes...

You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
Have I got things to tell you!
What happened?
I'm engaged.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
I am.
WHAT?
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
You think he's too old for me?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Security.
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
I'll say there is!
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
Jerry - there's another problem.
Like what?
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Like when?
Like right after the ceremony.
Oh.
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
What's going on?
She's finally asleep.
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
That will take time.
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
-- as we will be.
Lara, please...
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
He'll be weightless.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
He will be odd, different.
Better let me talk to him.
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
Here?
More this way.
WHAT A JOKE...
WHAT A JOKE...
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
You work in the insurance department?
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
She got <u>paid</u>.
You know this guy?
Mrs. Peterson.
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
Its because Im shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
Steady it out!
Z!  Over here!
Hello?
Put that phone down!
Get me the Radio Tower!
I'm gonna need some money.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
The zoo?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Don't you remember?
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
What?
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
What?  You know him?
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
Really?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
He's sleeping.
Only we have to go to work.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Does he have to go?
Pardon me?
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
Nothin' too showy!
What was that?
What?
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
What did the beer cost?
Fifteen crowns.
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
What are you doing up?
I was thirsty.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
Easy, Animal! Easy!
Is smoking fun?
Oh, I suppose so.
Could I have a puff?
I don't think your mother would like that.
Come in.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
This is all my fault.
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
If you want to.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
"Octopus people?"
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
And you?
Waitin' for my wife.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Half.
What else then?
Lookin' for what's comin'.
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
Then you'll like me.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
What - the curtains?
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
But, Mother ...
Father, lad.
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
Rather what?
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
Lo?
I'll call you.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
What?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
It's undamaged?
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
So you can use it now?
Yes... I suppose so.
Go back to your own time?
You got everything you ever wanted.
That's it. We're ready.
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
Can we see?
You gonna buy?
I don't know.  Maybe.
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
I am now.
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
Order!
What are watchin' this junk for?
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
Who is it?
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
You're kidding.
Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
I could take after Dad, too.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I meant he's a doctor.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
You should have someone look after you.
It might show.
This has got to be one big violation...
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
He was interested.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
'It's up to Joe'?
I can't reach her.
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
Speak of the devil.
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Scottie?
Hmm?
Is she with you?
Who is this?
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
No.
Where is she?!
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
I told you I don't know.
One.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Leave me alone!
How much did you take off?
What kind of mine?
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  Youre making a business deal...
Give me my goddamn life back!
You?  What about me?  Im working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
Yessir, I can see that.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Uh, yessir.
Ready for hard work, son?
Ready for anything.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Gonna be like money from home.
It is time for the performance.
Yes.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
Let's go outside and talk.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
Well, thanks a lot.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
I could use a little vacation.
You want me to pick up a painting?
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
Another, Frank . . . ?
Don't let 'im get you tight.
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
Who's Guilder?
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Carter.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Yoda, I must know.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
I would say he's pretty depraved.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
How did you know your son was involved?
It was on the TV.
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
Did you know he was a homosexual?
No, not until after they killed him.
Did you always call him Junior.
Yeah.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
They're still behind us...
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
I'm not going anywhere!
Tubbs, these people mean business.
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
John loves the house.
You...
Getting there.
I got eggs down here!
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
What you wanna do?
I say something funny?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
Good night, mother, good night.
Fucker!
John Crawford?
Yes, sir.
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
He <u>has</u> to know...
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
And you've got BOTH axes?
Yes, Mother.
And something to sharpen them with?
Yes, Mum.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
No, Mother.
And keep your sword greased.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
He using her.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
One cannot love and kill.
We're alive.
What's wrong with her?
Is she a friend of yours?
I haven't danced in.....
I'm on my way, Starck.
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
Who are you going to see?
Hey, girls.
Hail, Mary.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Oh-huh.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Really.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
I could swear I heard my son call me.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
I won't ever tailgate.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
No.
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
Wish me luck!
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
Damn him.
What's wrong?
--whatever you want, no problem--
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
-- just --
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
-- let me do this, okay? --
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
I told them to fall back...
Transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink.
Destination?
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
She looks a lot like you.
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
When did you two talk this over?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
The family that steals together, deals together...
Dad'd be proud --
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
What era was that -- ?
The era when crime didn't pay --
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
Price of doing business...
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
Hey, honey.
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
Passport, please.
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, thats all it is!
John, John.
Don't do that!
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
She's just so... pathetic.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
What's his problem?
This is the only thing you found?
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
That's right.
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
How about this?
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
How does she like what in bed?
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Flip a coin.
Really?
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me
Just how serious is it, doctor?
My quarters.
Why is everything...like this?
Shhh! Liar.
It's the truth, Jake.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
Hello?
We caught 'em.
Good.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
Where are you?
Closer than you think.
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
To see your reaction.
Hey man, you can't do that!
We don't let go, you s...
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
Don't say another word, Valerie.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
I'm not listening.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
Nobody's hearing nothing!
Your mom take anything before this happened?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
This is healing?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
Are you a physician?
How is it you come to be here?
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
Ah. An explorer.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
I heard.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Creature? A... human like creature?
You know of it?
Your men are right to be afraid.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
You cold, James?
A little.
So what are you doing out here?
It's colder in there.
Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
What's your offer, Jesse?
Carlo!
What'd he look like?
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
What makes you so sure?
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
I'll order Riker to turn around.
Ms. Toller?
I said he did.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
You asked me not to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
Fifteen minutes.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
Thanks.
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
We had a tough year.
Who are you people?
But --
I wanted to see you...
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
Think there might be more Iraqis?
I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
Where's my paycheck?
Have you been logging on?
What?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
You did it.
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
He's an Italian?
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
You're not cured yet, my boy.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
Who's going to pay me then?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
How do you figure?
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
So that's what we're doing.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
That is absolutely not true.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Don't even think about it.
Why not?
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
If there was one.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
...No.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
Max.
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
Uh... dudes?
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
Hello, I'm --
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Yes, I --
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Pardon?
Jack!
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
Hello.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Mr. MacDougal.
It's not my alibi to tell --
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
Talk? About me--about us?
Precisely.
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
No--yours, madame.
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
What do you mean?
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
Been over to the other mill?
Yeah, I been there.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Religion?
C of E, sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Brown hair, is it?
Fair hair, sir.
Blue eyes?
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Prepare for warp speed.
Do you have a cigarette?
I don't smoke.
Yes, you do.
You okay?
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
What?
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
OK.  OK.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
What's that mean?
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
I wasn't going to try anything.
What say, Louis?
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
So where have you been staying?
Keep your mouth shut.
You know how to use this?
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
Huh?
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
What's to sketch?
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
Broke is more like it.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
Football in college.
You went to university?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
We got the permit.
Is that one hell of a kid?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
He's got a gift for fiction.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
What are you doing there?
Hiding.
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Ben did this.
Ben did this?
Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
No.  I'm fine.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
But it was horrible.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
So much for your nightfall.
Nah.
Why not? You stink.
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
With what?
Hey.
How are things goin' out there?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Apache?
Arachtoid.
Here, drink some of this...
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
Ahh.
What's up?
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
You would do that?
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
I don't like it.
Why not?
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
Marion. It's a book.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
It's the truth.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
No. I said Dunbar.
Is that kid still bothering you?
Which one?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
That was about a year ago.
Well, is he?
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
I paid you back.
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
Ellen.
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
Now get on with it.
We were going to do it.
Can I have a glass of water?
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Possibly some coffee?
The other one --
You have to win every point, don't you?
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
Of course.
Why?
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
He can't help us.
Do something!
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
You are, I've seen you.
It wasn't me. It was him.
It was you.
He told me what to do.
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
Father--oh.
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
Not that many.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Cool, bro, now listen up...
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
Good evening, Your Highness.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Count d'Algout...
I'm okay.
What?
Come in.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
Keep your eyes peeled.
... plastic.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Bonkers.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
No I'm not.
Yes... I... we had dinner.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
No, it was our first date.
So. What's that thing?
A Pilates machine?
What do you make with that?
What'd he say?
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
What'd you say?
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
You called, Doctor?
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
How come?
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
And what else is bothering you?
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
I don't like what he does.
It's his work.
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Not enough loving.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
You drove him to his torment.
And he drove me to mine.
Then why weep for him?
What are you doing?
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
Boy, you're really into this.
Mom, I mean dad...
Uh huh...
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
C'mon, there's not much difference--
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
All right. What are you gonna do?
I want 15 on the Mets.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
There they are!
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
What?
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Wait a minute . . .
What's this?
I thought you might paste them into your book.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
I'd like you to have them.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
How is he?
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
And if I don't?
But you know what's real now?
Got any more, Ma?
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?
See anything?
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
I thought you weren't dying.
...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
We must examine you.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Exactly.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
What the hell was that all about?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
What?
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
I don't want to go to jail for this.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
You're right, Joe.
Of course I am.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
No we're not.
We're not?
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
But suppose he loses?
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
But suppose it doesn't?
I just heard.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You be careful.
Eric! Are you here?
Okay, enough of this shit.
Is he...
Hell-
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
Ask him his name.
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
No. No one never did.
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
No --
Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
Why?
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
You knew...?
You really want to find this guy?
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
You're living.
Bret... what the fuck...?
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
Bret. What the hell is going on?
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
Is something the matter?
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
Who was this partner of his?
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
What's this for?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Don't you love my sexy body?!
What?
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
Oh?
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Parry...
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
You are...
I don't suppose I could watch.
Might be exciting for you.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
Short range scan.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
I found a cent!
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
Yuri... are you...
Detective, does it look like a murder?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Is it drug related?
Not much of a pass.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
I think so.
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Oh, is that what caused it?
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
How much money have you got?
Heaven knows. A lot.
Where are you now?
Here with you.
Where?
The tall trees...
Have you been here before?
Yes...
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
Can't move.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
So what should we do?
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
What is this?
Your father?
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
I guess we've been staying up too late.
Hey, where's Erica?
...tonight...
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
What if he's busy tonight?
<u>Lure</u> him. 
What are you saying...
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
...on the way in.
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
It's the White House.
Do you dream often?
Do you?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
Says who?
Says me. Do you dream often?
Supper for two.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
It's all right. It's organic.
Oh, Harold. 
What's the matter?
He likes you.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Barely, yes.
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Here's your fifty.
YOUNG PERSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT.
I don't believe in statistics.
I'll probably marry him.
Really?  That's sudden.
Amber? Here.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
How's my favorite President?
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I want an hour with him.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Can... can... Can I have this?
No...
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
With an unloaded pistol?
What is this place?
Some kind of archive --
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
Fancy a nibble?
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
I won't be using the room tonight.
I see.
I'm staying with a friend.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
It's not like that, luv.
An interface attendant.
Where?
Daddy!
Hi, Allison --
Have you got a minute?
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
So what?
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
Sure ... Where would we go?
Yes?
That's new, isn't it?
Couple of weeks... Listen --
What is it?
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
I know you smoke weed, right?
Why you say that?
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
I don't want to place you in any position --
-- to be put in that kind of position...
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Your aunt?
Mrs. Smith.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Right.
Well, which one?
Margaret.
Funny old bird.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Just relax....
What was that?
Clockworks.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.
That's fair enough.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
Went ballistic?
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
So what's it going to be?
Yeah, I guess.
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
All he can. All he can.
I need something to keep me awake.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Thanks.  Just some pills.
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
A man scared me.
A man?  Was it a dream?
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
I need a typewritter.
See?  It stopped.
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
Anderton --
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
Who is Merlin?
Then get out!
We go back.
What?  You gotta be joking.
Nice one.
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
Oh, OK.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
Why are you doing this?
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
So were you.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
But Scottie, you don't have to!
What?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
You think that'll help?
I'm sorry, George...
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
Yes, mam...
What do you want with my baby?
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
Everybody has a choice.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
Want a drink? I'm having one.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
It's the questions she asks.
Sorry. I'm better with men.
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
How nice -- your daughters?
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Definitely off.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
Shouldnt've done that.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
I know.
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Who is it?
Why didn't you cremate him?!
You got anything smaller?
Keep it.
It's a twenty.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
Oh, no.  Oh, no.
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
Cornelius!  How are you?
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Better than I've ever been in my life.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Ah!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Certainly!
They're all right, aren't they?
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Well, I'm sorry.
We don't know.
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
Who are you really?
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Yes, it is.
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Occupied France?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
What are they?
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
And the other alternative?
More endearments.
I like you, DIl
Love me.
Yes.
Tell me you love me.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Then say it.
Love you, Dil.
You do?
Yeah.
What would you do for me?
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
There are ads? For parents?
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
What?
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
But you're the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin' silent when you know the score I'm guilty you hear me? I'm guilty... .
I don't want to hear it in there.
I don't get it!
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
But you've got to listen to me.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Strong...
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
Uh-huh.
He tapped that.
Naw!
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
You used me, daddy!
You're poisoning that child's mind.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
Show me the way?
How we doin' on that vehicle?
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
No hard feelings?
Are you kidding?
I always said you were a gentleman.
How do you know she is a witch?
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Watch my back!
...she can go up there.
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Can I help you?
Oh.  I can't.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
What good will that do?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Closer to eight.
Touch her.
What?
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Bump?
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
Uh-oh.
What?
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
Okay.
Worth a try.

Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
...did you?
You're fucked, man.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...-tion?
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
...stole the truck.
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
...piece of shit was worth.
It won't even start half the time.
You know what I'm sayin'?
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
...or nephew or some good old boy...
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
...overdrawn bank accounts.
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
So you took his...
...truck.
So I took his truck, yeah.
 Yeah.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
Don't act so -- crazy.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
Give me a drink, will ya?
You don't need a drink.
Where are you going?
Home!
Home?
I'm fired.
Who fired you?
One hundred kilometers...
Did you have to use that much explosive?
I'll be damned.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Whatta we do now?
You fool -- you damn fool.
Come on, Fran.
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
Could we go somewhere?
I'm heading out of town.
Why?
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
How many shots you say you heard?
Four to six.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
What are you going to do?
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
I'm not much of a critic.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
Sure.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
They're right here.
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
That was my idea.
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Get water!
Fix raft first.
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Good night Walter...
Why would you call me from my front porch?
Who... who are you...?
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
Native costume?
It's the Queen's decision.
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
Well, they go to guard school.
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
You know why.  You already said.
What'd I say again?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
What?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
I said all that?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
Just let me go.
How can you tell it's a female?
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
I gave it to him yesterday.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
No, I left it in his office.
Did you see him?
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
I know. I know.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
She's as good as gone...
Caesar, ignore them.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Jesus...
What is it? Where's Casey?
You feeling any better?
A little bit.
Guess what.
What?
Your grandfather's here.
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
You are sick, that's why he's here.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
Please, call me Mordechai.
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Hope you're proud of yourself.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
Give it to me.
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
I'm having a stroke.
Miles.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
How's the trip?
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
And?
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Huh.
So this is it, right?
You found it in the barn, hey?
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
Someone get a doctor.
There's one coming.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Entering the upper ionospere...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
Welcome home.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
What?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
Are you insane?!
Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!
Fuck you.
Why are we stopping here?
Let me alone, will you?
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
I understand.  No, I'm not.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
What is this?
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
And Larry?...
What about Larry?
Now, just a minuteyou can't
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
Thank you.
Would you like the same suite?
Here, Captain.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
What's the question mark?
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
How do you do that?
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
You're what?
I think you heard me, Bill.
William.
I couldn't resist them.
What do you have here, Billy?
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
Isn't he?
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Are they?  Why would they?
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
I would make you rich.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
--I saw him. He verifies.
What did he bring him in for?
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Just for him?
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Up where?
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoelaces; now this sudden humility.
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
I'll handle that later.
My readings indicate great instability.
Yes, uh...
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Tucker?
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
I think we should go.
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
Not for me, it ain't.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
I don't believe this.
Mitchell was too drunk.
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
What happened?
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
I'm proud of you.
Yeah?
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
There is going to BE a wedding?
Oh.  Oh yes.
Well can I come in or not?
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
LULA!!!!
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
I want to buy you a drink.
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
Seating problems.
Okay.
Keith do not trivialize this.
I'm not. What's the problem?
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
What kind of seats can we have?
Not padded ones.
So what do we do?
You go down there.
Go down where?
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Honey I don't have the time...
I need your help.
We're leaving in three hours.
I need your help.
I'll call them from the road.
Do you love me?
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Take care of those chairs.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Thanks, Grandpa...
Is there anything else?
A drink...
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
You look like a rock star without a job.
What is this?
Hidden camera.
Wings?
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN.
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out we take our cut.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
It'll do.
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
I'm gonna get beside him.
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Yes, I know.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
I don't know what you're talking about.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
Will you excuse me?
I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
Out of the question.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
Jake --
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
Not a thing.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
What is it?  Anything wrong?
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
You don't have watches?
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
I'm not hungry.
Then say so.
Yes, Addison.
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Yes, Addison.
Is this him!?
Don't hurt him...
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
Don't know that it does.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
What about the uranium?
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
That's no way to talk...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
I'm here.
See you tomorrow -
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Got a warrant?
You fit a lot of descriptions.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.

Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Oh.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
Oh, honey... What happened?
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Is that your version of a pep talk?
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
Fine!
Sam.  Is everything all right?
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Emily?
Your wife.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
Get to your cars!
Oh my God!
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
H'm?
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
It was only a mouthful!
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
I hope you're right...
Lemme see that.
Jean?
Yes, Patrick?
Fuck.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
Should we make a run for it out the back?
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
No, Animal.
No?
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Don't worry about it.
There are cops all over the place.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
I'm sure he's busy.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Yes, desperately.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Better than I...
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
They must've just missed me.
They said you had to run out.
I'm sorry. That was...
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
How potent?
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
We?  You've taken it?
We all did.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Oh, wow, she's great.
Have we met?
I don't think so.
Did you know Sebastian well?
You might say that.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
That's right.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
I'll stay here also.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
Huh?
I don't know what that signal means.
Why's she blind, Bro?
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Just be careful, okay?
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
Guess so.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
But it's a small room, Jason.
It's mine?
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
Find it?
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
Walter Sobchak.
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
James is... I don't know...
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
I'm not sure that's possible.
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
How did you get this gig?
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
No wallet, huh?
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
Why not.
Are you serious.
Are any of them inhabited?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Population?
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
And if I cut my hair again?
It will grow back again!
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Maybe I better start working on him.
Where are we going?
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Yes.
Were you recently promoted?
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
You...
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
What's the idea?
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
You think you are ready now?
Yes, my lord.
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Oh, yeah?
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
I have to get back.
I'll have lunch ready by one.
I'll be back.
At one. Promise?
What is it?
Her heart.
Can you give her something?
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Oh yes you are!
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
What? Really?
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
Yeah, he can go ...
Am I interrupting something?
Not at all.
Where's our friend?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
No.
You mean this thing?
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
A deer?
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
You still carrying passengers?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
Harold, calm down! This is...
What the fuck are you doing?
Coming with you.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
I don't know about that?
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
I'm not sailing his boat.
But I thought --
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
Anywhere?
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
Franks and beans!
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
A teleprompter.
Tell me about yourself.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
That's it?
Not much else.
What's your business?
I'm a professional killer.
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.
Listen...thank you.
Well, that's that.
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
Says who?
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Full clip to the body --
From up close or far away?
His chest was hamburger --
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
And you and Private Graves--
That bag's almost empty.
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
Where are you from, Creasy?
The United States.
I put you away --
Yes, you did.
You made those tapes...
They were performance pieces.
You set your patients on fire!
Thanks for the promotion, man.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
...He knows.
What?
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
You're sure nobody's following us?
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
Are you stupid or what?
What?
Stan and I're okay.
Yah.
We're good to loan in.
Yah.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
They're my friends.
I wasn't doing anything.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
You said it was urgent.
No more fuckin' dirty work!
No, no, no, no!
The code key, please...?
You  must  open  me  up  again?
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
He tried to kill me last night.
Where?
How much does it cost?
What's wrong with me?
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
Sneaking around with your brother?
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
Why do you play at being drunk?
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
No. What happened?
Hello, Ralph.
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
Thank you, sir.
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
I'm fine, sir.
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
And you believe the NLF?
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
J. S. Bach.
Jim West.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Funny.  So am I.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Phil.  What are you doing?
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
How did you guess?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Why --
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
Now, what makes you think that?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Great story Goober, how much?
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.
You can't go now.
I have to.
What did you pay Nilsen?
Tell Mom, you know...
Darker.  More...evil?
Yeah...how'd you know?
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Mitchell.
A little something on account perhaps?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
It's okay.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
What?
Except yourself!
Will you wait a minute?
You know how to work this thing?
No idea.
Well, press something!
Look, food!
That's not food.  Can't be food.
Come on!
Where's Kelly?
How deep IS the ocean?
Yes, of course  but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
Because this must be stopped.
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
I think it's not horrible.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Then you've read it?
Not yet.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
There a part in it for you?
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
Sounds fair.
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
Been thinking?
I have the White House on the Line.
What?  What?
Nothing.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm going on over there...
I'm not some piece a crap.
I know you're not.
You treat me like I was.
I'm sorry.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
Boy!
What?
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
The King pipeline.
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
Probably an asteroid field ....
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Sure, I guess.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
Man, that's great. That's just great.
You catch Dylan?
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
You have a raccoon?
Tsch, a few.
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
I can think of another word.
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Are you?
Yeah.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Why there?
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
'Scuse me?
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Fuckin' A.
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
What brings you out to the sticks?
Had a package to deliver.
You?  Personally?
I had it on the island with me.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
I want to do it.
What's the plan?
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
Not my room!
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
The prefix code?
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
Jesus
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
Please don't ask me to do this.
I'm tired now.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
St. Anne's?
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
You were unhappy?
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
The reason?
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
I see.
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
Sit down.
That something I shouldn't see?
Which way did he go?
Calm Down! Act rational.
Yeah?
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
What are you talking about?
Gabriel, you promised!
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
I'll hitch.
John Ultramalensky, right?
Right.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
What are you going to do?
Father... I killed those men...
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Oh no.
No no. I knew.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
Are you still here?
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
But you're Irish!
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
Youre moving...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
To Paris. Paris, France.
Thats the one...
So youre not at a non- profit firm?
Not with what they pay me...
Youre not married, are you?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
Merde.
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
Hmm!
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Uh, losers!  All losers!
You're too demanding.
What is that?
Braces.
Braces?
Yes.
You don't need braces.
Yes I do.
I have friends.
Deleon.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
And how the hell are we going to do that?
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
Ring that number, will you?
Come here. See if we can move it.
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Will you come here?
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
He said he heard hammering.
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
Something... I've got...you don't.
You rich kids... are all the same !
Shit...
What is it?
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
Where do you --
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
What does it mean, Indy?
Okay.
What's her name?
Betty.
What's she like?
What? She asked.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Okay?
Are you sure?
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
Unnhh.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
Urgh.
Mostly what.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In Manhattan?
Of course. Where else?
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
That's where the what comes in.
The what?
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....
You're not going to bet it all....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
How long had that been going on?
What's the problem?
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
I know this.
I love you.
I'm listening.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
Mookie's OK.
You listening to me?
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
How do you know this?
I know.
You really think so?
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
I came to warn you...
How am I supposed to get away?
Cotter'll kill you.
He'll never know.
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
...yes. Get her on the phone...
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
Gruber...
It'll be over soon.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Yes, sir!
Louder!
Yes, sir!!
What's your deal with Alyssa?
Don't even...I'm there.
I wasn't sure.
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Let's go the zoo.
What's happened...
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Your friends use the pool too.
I take out the garbage.
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
The Scots will fight for us?
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
We're not even sure what it was.
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
Yeah. I can imagine.
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
A game?
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
What are you talking about?
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
I'm sorry, about this...
The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
And some problems cannot be settled without one.
What is it?
This is what we've been waiting for.
What are you saying?
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
I made her nervous.
What do you mean?
Where's your gun?
What's happened?
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
No, just give you a splitting headache.
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
Oh.
Lay it on me.
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Aye-aye, captain.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Yes, Miss.
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer?  Well, all right.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Ale. I don't mind.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Yeah.
How much did he pay you?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
Fag.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
Thanks for reminding me.
Tormented -- ? Why?
I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
Then you found the leopard --
What, just the three of us?
Do you talk to him?
When we're making love?
Yes.
Sometimes. Afterward.
That's good.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Yeah. But not any more.
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
Got a problem, Meurice?
What is it?
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
Oh God. Shit...
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You think I scam?
You're unlucky.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
An hour?
Mmm.
Maybe I better start our homework.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Call me.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Panes is here!
Oh... a Dorothy.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
Hello? Computer...?
Just use the keyboard...
Well, sure!
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Now, what do you want?
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
That's cool.
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
Signs?
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
But it's light in there now.
You better get going, hon.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Louis, are you sure?
I, I was asked to do this material - -
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
At one in the morning?
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
I think it's rather extraordinary.
That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Is he in love with you?
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
Good morning.
Morning.
I wonder if you could help me.
Try my best.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
What you lookin' for, mon?
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
I waited up till midnight.
You weren't waiting for me.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
Be still ...
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
You must be freezing.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
See you.
It's possible
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Because she's sick.
May I get the check?
I guess we open it.
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
Home.
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
That's right.
Where?
Hospital.
Which hospital?
Back home.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
Deco.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
That...? Vestibule.
How about -- ?
Kill him.
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
You guys are playing music?
...Now that's aggravating.
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
But
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
What are you running from?
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
Two words.  Disco Express.
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
'Booty Time.'
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
Like me.
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
Poster-Kleiser.
Oh yeah?
That's right.
I'll call you.
Fine.
See you later.
Which way did he go?
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
Hello, Mr. Connell.
What?!  What's happening?!!
You're officer of the watch, George.
He wasn't.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
Feel what? You okay?
Something was definitely here.
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
What is it?
What?
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
Lots of things...
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Shoot.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
As for example, what?
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Vampires of the world, beware.
If you'd like.
That's not the worst part.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
I said play!
350 pounds.
What?
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
It can be documented that he displayed the...
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
Primary bomb is live.
All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
Leave her alone!
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Great.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
You will keep in touch.
Of course. Every day.
O.K.
Take care, Dad.
Call me tomorrow.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Have you no respect for the dead?
That's enough.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
She can't remember.
Maurice?
Yes.
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
Go to sleep Ellen.
Do you work tomorrow?
Same time. What about you?
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
I'll call you. Let you know.
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
Helluva day.
To say the least.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Get the fuck outta here already.
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
We know that...
Can I have an evil twin?
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
I don't know, George...
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
I'll think about it.
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
I said I'll think about it.
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
Hmm?
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
If I can help you ...
Not.
How long have you known my father?
Thirty years. Maybe more.
How would you describe him?
Smokes?
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
You can't be too careful.
Where's Kader?
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
Come on, come on!
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
No.
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
I felt you...looking through me...
We walked all night...
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Are there any more at home like you?
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
Just below ten thousand.
I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Henry, the pen --
What?
Come back tonight.
Tonight?
Alone.
What for?
Some service deserves service in return. No?
What do you mean?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
I didn't know you taught.
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Courtyard?
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
Those Rockefellers!
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
How long do you intend -- ?
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Sure.
Do I make you horny?
What?
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
No shit, Kevin?
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
I'd like to thank the academy...
I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Do you know him well?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
Yeah, no problem.
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
What are you doing?
It's freezing, isn't it?
Baxter?
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
If you got something to say, say it.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
You don't know the procedure.
Of course.
And a car.
Oh, my God!
That's right.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
That is so right.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
Now, that's really stupid.
Yes!
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
Oh, hi.
Buy ya a beer?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
You know her?
It can't be.
Who is she Daddy?
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
We're not skipping this treatment.
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
Fuck you.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
Well... G'bye.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
Huh?
Myra followed you, huh?
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
No.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
As though you do what I say.
Do you know a Marie?
No... do you?
Why should I?
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
How's the beautiful lady?
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
Well -- last night was not so good.
I thought she was splendid!
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Uh oh.
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
Hi.
I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero...
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
You got a nice crib here.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
There ya go.
We're cool.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !
What are you doing?
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
Jack. What are you doing here?
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
Yeah.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
It wasn't a joke.
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
This time...
We'll come again.
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
Pleased to meet you.
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
Long day. Go to sleep.
Am I too heavy for you?
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
How were we -- were we cool?
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
I haven't been nice to you.
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
Why don't we just take these -
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Who else knows about the boy?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Is she on the phone?
Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
That might work.
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
Well, yeah.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
Thank you.
How you doing, man?
Oh....Say something.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
So watcha doin'?
Nothin'.
What are you doin' here?
I, umm, came to see you.
You know somebody around here?
No.  What you do today?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize its over, youre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, well go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
We dont have to, Jim.  Hell come after us.
Whats going to make him do that?
What he didnt get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
You cheated.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
What is that?
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
How heroic of you...
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
You what?
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
Maestro.
Good morning.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Yes.
Is there a part for me?
No.
How do you know?
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
Why not?
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Where?
In a harem.
What's that?
A brothel.
Oh!
A Turkish brothel.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
What did he want?
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
I told you...
Judy, that's stupid.
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
You know that's impossible!
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
What's the pig's name?
Brimmer.
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
Yeah.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
No, that's not, I couldn't...
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
He is dead.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Try next of kin.
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
Hey.
Where'd you get this fag shit?
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Pass.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
I told you. I like you.
See, I never knew that.
Well now you do.
Do you miss him?
What do you think?
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
Do I?
What was she like?
Who?
Catherine Tramell.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
So -- which Dakota you from?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
How many people go here?
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
What just happened?
What for, Sheriff?
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
You wanted to meet here?
Most of the times.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
Something happened to you.
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
Radiation interference?
You should call your Grandmother.
There may be a hunting party.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
Wait ...
I've got to go ...
It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
I don't see the point in that.
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
Then I'm here till I die?
Till they kill you. Yeah.
Then why bother curing me?
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
Are we havin' fun or what?
I thought we were goin' into town.
We saw the broads.
All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
What?
... . Ellen.
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
Oh... Yeah.
Mind if I sit down?
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
Will you come soon?
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
...within five minutes.
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
You're back!
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
Let's go over it. Where are you?
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Mr. Brown?
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
What about the gold?
What about it?
Maybe we should split it up now.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
We're leaving.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Vegas? What'd you think?
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
Impressions? Those are hard.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
A scary dream?
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
What a good idea.
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
I just don't want to fight with you.
Beautiful night.
Yeah.
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
No problem. What's on your mind?
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
Whatever.
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
Sure.
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
I agree with what you said...truly.
What did I say?
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Why?
No, I don't.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
To what?
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
Dwayne listen to me -
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
I don't know what you're -
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
Where's your brother?
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
I can't do that.
I want to be put on this case.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Who's running it?
Roper...
Who's running it!
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
I'm hungry.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
What's that supposed to mean?...
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
Where does he live?
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
Pull my laces tighter.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
Wilfred.
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
Why's that?
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
I don't like that one.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
But we accomplish the mission.
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
No, sir.
Good job, not pretty, but good.
No.  Did you?
No.  I missed that.
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
We're great.
I mean, you're really back.
Not ready? Where is she?
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
It's not him, Dad.
Charlotte?
Hi, Bob.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
No.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
What was she running from?
I don't know.
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
Yes.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
Why do you think he did it?
It got to be too much for him.
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
I didn't mean to...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
I had to ask.  I apologize.
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Denver is where he should be.
I'll give it everything.
Don't touch me.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
No.
Elaine --
What? What are you talking about? Where?
The child!
Yes.
There's no child here.
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
Sometimes I really hate you.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
We're going to work on the message.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
The most logical choice.
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
Don't do it!
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
What little old man?
That little old man.
Leave her alone, you fiend!
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
If I could get my hands on you...
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
Leave her alone, I tell you!
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
I... no, I... I just can't...
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
Oh, God.
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Where's it coming from?
It's unbelievable!
I told ya.
Wow!
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Could you believe those girls!
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
A delivery device for nicotine.
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
You're gonna get your fix...
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
Most certainly.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Poor communication skills.
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Eric told me of your bereavement.
Yep.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Yeah.
Nasty way to go.
What about Sal?
It's me.
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
You okay?
I'm fine.  What's up?
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
Don't make me have to use this.
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
How will I know?
I'm sorry?
How will I know what she requires?
You'll be sent a message.
Who'll bring it to me?
Her Highness' Equerry.
I need a man who knows where I am.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
Where am I?
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
That was cold...
I worry for you.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
Nice of you to come.
Good luck, Richard.
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
I'm not telling you.
Why not?
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
Berry-picking.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
And what's that?
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Mm-hm.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
You think John would like it?
But why, Gray? Why?
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
A pleasure to torment me?
Aloha! Welcome!
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
You switched the charts; you tell me.
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
You look better than ever.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
She seemed upset.
What?
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
That son of a bitch.
That'd be my reaction too --
He's lying.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
What are there character traits?
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Exactly!
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Yep, you guessed it.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
What expenses?
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
You gotta go back out there.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
Uh. Do you like England?
That's very nice.
I like you.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
Sorry?
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
Sugar?
Get me Room 414.
I love you.  I always will.
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
Ask away, Major.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
I don't think so, sir.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
I see.
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
I'm trying to, sir.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
That's close enough, Major.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
Nuthin' I can't handle.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Where do you go from here?
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
I didn't mean that, in life.
Who is this?
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
What?
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
I want to be alone.
Hello.
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
You've got her? Where?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
Of course I do. Where are you?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
What are you talking about?
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
What did he say to you in French?
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
Austin, I'm coming with you.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
...Maybe I better forget it.
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
Did he give you his name?
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Fine..
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
French?
Yes sir.
Where are we?
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
What's that?
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
You know I'm a good person.
Mmm hmm.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Hudson, don't you understand...
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
Is this great fabric or what?
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
What...what is that?
Listen, what about dinner?
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
Who's side are you on?
I beg your pardon?
What if I plead guilty?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
If I don't cooperate?
What the hell can I do?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
If I were?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
My leg is falling asleep.
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
I am.
Your own work?
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
I don't want to talk about him.
Fine.
It's none of your business.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
One minute.
I think this is about where we came in.
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Is this a lover?
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
Your mother's not dead.
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
No, he's gone.
I knew he wouldn't come.
The power.
Mitch...
What brings you here?
This is great reefer.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
What are you shooting for?
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom.'
Don't you get along with your parents?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
Howdy!
Used to what?
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
But how could you say such a thing?
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
And have you any other truths to tell me?
You already know what they are.
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
She's in the other room.
Hey.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
Because it's your job, that's all.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Are you playing tricks on me?
What?
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
What do you want?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
About what?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
So?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
What do you want?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Leave me alone.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Are they?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
I do not seek forgiveness.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
How well are you trained in music?
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Where?
Here in Vienna.
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
I guess I just don't understand anything.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Why?
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Why did you change your name?
Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His "Fix."
What do you want?
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
What do you get out of it?
Peace of mind.
That's it?
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
I mean for Ted.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Think you can figure it out?
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
You do not.
Yes I do.
You don't...
In the corporate offices.
Oh... really?
Yeah...
What do you do?
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
You do not.
It's what I do.
You're so funny...
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
--Stop it--
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
--No.
Everything okay?
Yes, thank you very much.
John said you're Amish.
Yes.
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
What?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
Well, what is it?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
What's that stand for?
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
I'll deal with you later.
I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.
When?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
What an incredible view !
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Yeah? What's his name?
Victor Laszlo.
What was the part?
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
No!
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
Does wood sink in water?
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
He's lying.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Thanks are hardly necessary.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
It ain't for lack of trying.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
And what about love?
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
No, I wouldn't.
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
...Be careful.
I always am.
Don't get hurt.
I never do.
Don't hurt no one.
Patrick -- is that- a.
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Uh-uh.
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
I don't fuckin' cook.
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
I can handle that.
Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
That's not correct.
What's wrong with it?
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
Air lock?
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
I just want to be a superhero.
Next week we work the park.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
What do you mean?
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
Ro, how long have we known each other.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
He had girlfriends!
He says --
I'll see you around.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
...what...?
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
I'm frightened.
Of what?
Of telling you.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
I almost got married once.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
Lovely.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
How did it go today?
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
What are you doing on the wall?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
What for?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Do you think this cross will protect you?
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Killing her won't solve anything.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Yes.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
Hey --
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Sorry, love.
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
Well Filmore--
Well Cooper...
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
No, sir...
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
Good times.
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
What's the rush?
Did you feel that?
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Me like-y.
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
Is he with the girl?
Hello, Rae.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
He went back for his brother.
We said 48 hours.
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
Switch hands.
What?
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
You were?
No, M'lord.
What kind of jewel is this?
I don't know.
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
No.
That was close --
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
xxxxxx
Stop brushin' me back!
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
He told you that?
Yes sir.
Are you sure?
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
Are you in pain?
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
Even Data?
You stole my boat.
Good morning, my lord!
You have him in restraints.
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
What do you mean?
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
Let go of me!
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
I -- lost something.
Help yourself.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
I copy.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
I can't.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
You want something to drink?
What are you doing?
What?
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
You're right.  Talking too much again.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
Because I am a moral person.
Bullshit!
Bullshit yourself!
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
You just said...
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Nothing...
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
You forgot the milk.
You know that, son.
Hard luck -- like me.
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
That's what some folks say.
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
Good luck.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
Aren't you coming?
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
You fucking liar!
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Kent!
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
So, this could be your last night, huh?
Could be, I guess.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
He's making a fine recovery.
How's the new job?
Where does he think he's going?
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
With what?
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
I can't fuckin' do this.
Are you alright?
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
Was that your dad?
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
Where am I?
Lennox Hospital.
I'm awake?
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
That's a lie. My family was here.
I'm sorry.
 







No.
Where's Elvis?!
Dead, last time I...
 ...checked. 

We had a good laugh, didn't we?
You must leave?
Yeah...
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
Positive.
You sure?
Positive.
My friend told me she lived around here.
Your friend must be misinformed.

Goddamn it, Ma-...
...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
...it.
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
...-time,  remember?
Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
I can handle it.
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Tempus fugit!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul!
Gerade aus dann links!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
I want a job, Giles.
All right. As what?
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
Are you going to meet with him?
It worked!
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Uh... sure.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
Where did you get this?
Pike never confessed.
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
Oh, I've seen these...
Hey.
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Do you think they ever existed?
Yes I do.
Do you want to become one?
Become?  One is born a saint.
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
We'll figure it out.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
No.
Then why?
There's no reason.
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Get out of here, Lando!
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
This ought to be good.
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
Oh, yes.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
Hey buddy!
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
This is Chaz.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
What's up?
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
... Why the mask?
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
What do you want?
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Mister LaPlante...
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Mister LaPlante...
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Mister LaPlante...
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
Hey, Brat!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Are you talking to me!
So thrive my soul--
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
By the hour of nine.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
So how's Tombstone treating you?
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
Note. Put it in the note.
Why did yo do this for me?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
I've got to get her out of here.
-- go ahead.
-- well aren't you --
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
Who?
She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
I thought I was in good shape.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
I told you where I was.
All night?
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
Jim -- what's wrong?!
It was last year.
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
I need to leave you now.
I will treasure this.
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
No way... Would you?
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
No. I never feel like that.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Is it about my teeth?
Yes.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
You know him?
Owns the hardware store.
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
Play along?
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
And no one'll know about this?
It'll be our secret.
You're very late.
Sorry.
Please don't do it again.
I said I was sorry.
You leaving that on?
Yeah.
All night?
Yeah.
We're gonna be here a week?
Yeah.
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
Yeah.  You mind?
Why would I mind?
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
You love sharks?
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
Apparently.
Thank you.
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
People do have heart attacks.
Where'd you go?
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Oh. Hi.
What happened to your eye?
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Don't worry. He's out of town.
How far out of town?
You must be a Londrigan.
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
I am not mad.
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
Don't want weak legs.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
-- The legs.
Not yet.
Maybe we can get in by the top.
You want to try?
You want me to stick around, I could --
It's a very big one.
Very, very?
Yes -- very, very big!
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
Fuck that. We're going too.
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
Is that so?
Ouch. How many?
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
Okay, I'm thinking.
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
One.
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
Okay.
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
Not yet.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
Who's the subject?
You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece - the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
It's bona fide!
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
These four wagons must be his.
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
And that is?
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Even in Berlin.
I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
What are they doing?
Fuck.
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
But all these people...
So?
Nothing.
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Let's.
Yes.
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
What's your name?
Alexander.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
No, we created the Morlocks.
Created?
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
As slaves.
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
Are you calling me?
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
You mean you blew it.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
Really?
It's about to be a broken face.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Nope.
What do you think's going on?
Could be anything.
Been checking your messages?
Obsessively.
Huh.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Get out. Both of you.
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
Now, Swana...
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
What does it say?
Dr. John Whittlesley.
What's that doing here?
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
It's a thought.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
See if they'll what?
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
Please -- oh, no -- please!
That ain't no happy child.
The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
GET OFF ME!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
Do you like to read?
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
They still around, your folks?
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
How do you know?
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
How did your mama die?
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
You're leaving?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Is that a boat?
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Yep.
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Death is a very light thing for you.
I've loved you all my life
I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
Starling...?
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Your mom made that all by herself.
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
What?
Well, I don't know about that --
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
We could live it up and --
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Yeah.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
Yeah.
That's them trying to kill us.
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Of course.
Where are you?
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
I don't know...
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
I don't know...
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
What are you talking about? Vegas?
VEGAS.
What Vegas?
We're going to Vegas.
When?
Tonight, baby.
You're crazy.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
I'm not going to Vegas.
The address?!
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
I love Michael...
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
This is against the rules.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
-Okay okay.
What was that?
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
You need my help?
You're late.
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
Next week.
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
No, no, we're fine...
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
When was that?
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
Sister Paul?
No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
It's...42 56 76 .
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
Doug, I can't just leave you!
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
I did too!
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
What?
I guess you're okay.
Thank you.
He hates me.
Say that again, son.
I beg your pardon?
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
Don't come back.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Who's Charles Colson?
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
Who's Colson, Harry?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
If I may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?
Behind in your dues? How much?
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
Well?
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
Oh-oh.
What?
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
...what...?
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
Mikey, I hoped...
Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
That's right.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Report.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
How much homework is there?
That's the downside. There is none.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
Please, Letty.
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
I'm not really hungry.
Thanks, Mark.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
I don't have a pistol.
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
Absolutely sure.
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
There is nothing to discuss.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
You don't make enough.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
What's that supposed to mean?
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
I've been doing good, though.
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
Ye...
'Is it really me?'
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
What happened?
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
Get in the car.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
That's the way of the world.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
Sir, that's great news. But how -
So that's it...
Now what's wrong?
I've completely lost their signal.
Can you get them back?
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
...mmm?
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
Izzat the thing...
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
I did not.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
You... in the Navy?
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
Why?
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
Who gave you this idea?
You were saying...
Limp dick?
That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
Cole, we've got to talk.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
No, Cole, I...
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Crawfords.
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
I can't stay on this planet.
No one's traveling in this weather.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
You promised.
Locked.
Have we met?
A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
We felt his presence.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Yes?
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
Wait.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
Yes.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Why?
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
February first.
The same day she supposedly went down.
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Miss me, baby?
I dunno, boy.
Hm?
It's a bitch.
A bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
We've never met.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
Of course. What happened to your face?
I thought we had separate rooms.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
What are these men doing up wandering around?
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
I've ordered nothing from you.
This is a gift.
I take no gifts from you.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Get out of here!
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
Shit!
This is the second opinion.
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
What have you come up with on the riddle?
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
No.
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Hi. where's Cato?
Well, he's gone.
Gone?... Where?
He said not to tell.
Oh yeah?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
Ah... no...
Is it safe for them here?
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Ta.  Ta.
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Let's just forget it, I mean...
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
Myers??? How's your arm?
Who's the best? Say it.
Can't you use something else?
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
Listen to me good, Evan...
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
Let's go!  Let's go!
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
The airport.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
Can we get together while I'm in town?  I so badly want to sit for you again.
Sit?
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
Maybe you're right.
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
Yeah?
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
Sure.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
Are we good?
Will I still be able to play?
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
Fuck you.
Why?
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
Most certainly.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
That's a reasonable assumption.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
Doubts?  About what?
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
Now wait a minute--
--And confuse him--
--Gerry--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
Hold on!
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
"Undermine?"
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
Oh, come on, Sean--
--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
Oh, that's nice--
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
--I'm not angry at you--
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
--I don't have any anger at you--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
He won't be a failure!
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Another five years, huh?
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Or are you too scared?
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Then do it.
Fine, I will.
Fine, you do it.
And then shut down the pipe lines.
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
Thanks for coming.
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
What's that?
Genesis, what's that?
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?
What did you hear ?
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
I was.
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
Then what do you want ?
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Why?
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
Am I home?
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
Are we in Brooklyn?
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
You're late, asshole.
Fine, and how are you?
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
Yes.
What time in the morning was this?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Yeah.
then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
They were in a quandary, and
Come on, Lovey.
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
Yes?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Where?
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
I know that.
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
Nope.
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Yep.
Anyone else residing there?
Nope.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Rennie...??
A cheque.
The refund for Tuttle!
Tuttle?
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
That's missile lock!
He better be kidding!
You have?
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
You know, you --
It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
That doesn't make sense.
Add it to the list.
O.K.  Where's the cash?
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
I was afraid of that.
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
It's about me and David.
The perfect couple, I should say.
You mustn't take it so badly.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
Don't you ever stop?
All my clothes --
Scully?
Visit from my father.
Do you have to quit the play?
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
Thanks.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
Tch.
I tried to tell you...I tried....
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
I think I have no money.
It's okay.  Forget it.
But I would like to buy you drink.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Vodka!
Shot of vodka, please.
Thank you very much.
Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Didn't even have to ask.
...Who?
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
No.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
I don't care. I'll wait.
For what?
MacReady!
What?
Garry's missing!
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
Who are they?
Where you from?
What is this?
Not too good at small talk, eh?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
Yes, I'm ready now.
Hey, Ace.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
Are you all right, honey?
Dad!
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
Well, when are you quitting?
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
You bet I do, sir.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
That was my favorite part!
Uh, Captain...
PUSH!
How's Dee?
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
One more?
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
Great.  Give me a grant.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Oh shit.
You can't talk underwater!
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
What?
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
Good.  He never doubted you.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
I flinched.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Time is running out.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
My God!  Look!
Something the matter?
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
So what do you want me to do?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
I don't work in Toontown.
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
Well.  What about it?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
So?
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Yeah, but whose point of view?
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
What time is it?
Eight-thirty.
Eight-thirty?
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Your treat.
You mean we'd be dead?
Head for the roof!
I have to find Kelly!
I think she's with Sarah!
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
Is she dead?
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matine.
First time in New York?
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
It's home.
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
Hello.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
There's a million places to hide around here.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
I hope not.
Yori... hey...
Seventeen meters.
Dance?
Just passing through Santa Carla?
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
Yeah? Really?
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Mr. M.?
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
Yeah. That was a good party.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Margo, really...
Your health...
What'd you tell that casino manager?
Nnn... nothing...
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Good morning.
Don't tell me --
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
What are you doing?
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
I see...
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
When did this happen?
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
An accident?
No.
But you wanted to.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Dorothy Vallens?
They're... not here anymore.
Yes...What is it?
What's what?
What do you want?
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
What?
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Then who did?
How long do we have?
I don't know.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
What are you going to do?
It's incredible! How did you do it?
What?
Hey, Lowell.
How are you, Jim?
Oh!  You're here.
What have you got, Egon?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
She's in the green.
Lock fuel rods.
Locked.
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
You've got to listen...
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
How long would they let me sleep?
Where... where am I?
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Reed?... Sue?
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
What sort of task?
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
So do I.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
They payin'?
Are you going home?
No.
So where's Buckaroo?
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
Tough break.
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--it's urgent!
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
Come on.  Try.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
I hate when you say that.
Will!
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
Take it easy, Walter.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
Shall we go on?
He did it to make you stay with him!
Looks like some sort of code.
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
Has anyone died?
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Great.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
With these?
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
If I say no?
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
Bullshit.
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
You know about this stuff?
I helped Jamie with the first one.
I thought she built it herself.
I don't need the money.
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Why?
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
How?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
Sorry man.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
... Sometimes they do.
Listen Nolan
What are you down here for to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.
Ted?  Are you there?
Yeah.
Any prospects?
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
How the hell are you going to do that?
Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...
Looks nice enough to m...
You said we were special.
George, come back!
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
You mean a picture?
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
I don't see anything.
Squint harder.
Please, Ted.
Try this one.
This is like nursery school.
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
The creature?
Why?
You go in for dangerous things.
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Can I come with her?
You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
There ain't.
Then what do I do?
Mom--I mean, dad?
Uh, huh?
What did you do when you were little?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
Congratulations.
You've been reading for hours.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
It's temporary.
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
They get hair all over the place.
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Thanks, Lloyd.
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Do you really think I'm mad?
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
Stop it!
She's nothing to do with me.
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
Yes, ma'am, it is.
I'll give you fifty cents.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Direction's east coming!
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Not as yet, sir.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
A lie?
MAMA!
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
But mama..
How are you feeling today?
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I feel much better. Thank you.
Are you comfortable here?
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
You may not like what you hear.
I can take it.
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
We're too young.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
Juliet who?
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
There.
That's all you're bringing?
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
What time?
I dunno...
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
Yeah.
Where are you going?
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
I have to talk to you.
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
And no one found the ring?
Why haven't they killed the juice?
Switches are shorted out.
You're shitting me!
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
Can't shut em' down from here.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
Why do you hunt them?
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
Will you lighten up, please?
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
That's like your car, Beverly,
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
Get her!
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
You've been working on this, huh?
Theodosia --
With Stargher I saw things...
What did you see?
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
Is that right?
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
What if I call you Nicky?
My wife used to call me that.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
Be nasty.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
It's a lie!
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
He will not!
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
I don't understand...what does he want?
Good Lord.
What are you going to do to him?
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
Do you mind?
You...you can't.
Paint it out.
Out?
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
She did a Harriman.
Wow.
What was that?
Ich said you left.
...You didn't take the product, did you?
What product.
The heroin. You don't have it.
No I don't have it.
What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
You're OK?
Yeah.
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
They were out of line --
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
I'll work it off.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
What?
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
So, that's it. I'm out?
I didn't say that.
Then what are you saying?
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
I don't understand.
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
No.
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
I know.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
Yeah. Sorry.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Yeah.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
Ruiz knows about this?
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
You told him you liked him.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
He'll work it off.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
You always do this to me.
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Let's cancel.
Is my family here yet?
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Hello, Jake.
How are you, Lou?
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Summer colds are the worst.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
What do we do now, Nick?
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
No way they could have seen it?
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
I know what you're going to say.
Do you?
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
It was bad, wasn't it.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Pleased to meet you.
You're worried about your college applications.
Youre out of your mind. Whats the idea?
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
There's no motels around here.
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Who the hell are all these people?
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Where's Audrey?
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
What?
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Me!? You where the one...
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
I'm okay, you go.
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
I SHOULD have been -
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
But I am not human. I am only -
Improved...how?
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.
Really?
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
And me? ...
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
What?
Mr. Castro.
Yes.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Stanzi!
Can this be stopped?
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
Are you solid with that?
No. I think it's fucked.
What are you doing?
Can you loan me a 20?
Sure. Why?
I'm going to the store.
One is all?
That was close...
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
My God, you've got one?
Wait a minute.
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
All right.  What do we do now?
Forget Tonya Randall.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
Then prove her wrong.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
What happened to Sway?
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
Edward Rama?
Eduardo.  Rama.
First time in a grav couch?
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
Where are we, baby?
Where we'll always be...
But.
These look kind of familiar.
Can I ask you something?
What?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
When?
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
You chickenshit punk...
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
No.
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Hi Vada.
Hi.
What are you doing.
Feeding my fish.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
Yes.
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
You mean about that gun?
Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
Nothing.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Have you read it?
Yah!
Jerome Lundegaard?
Yah!
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Yah.
My patience is at an end.
Yah.
Good day, sir.
I was playing naked.
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
It better be good.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
A vote is before the group.
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
I don't want the -
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
Eighty million doll --- ?
Are you alone in the house?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So who are you?
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
So where are you?
Are you all right, Dil?
Well, what are we waiting for?
Are you frightened?
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
What the hell is wrong with you?
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
What do you mean?
You know it and I know it.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Everything, but everything.
Oh, Laura.
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
So, what's your point?
Are you finished with me?
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
This is the home of an angel.
You OK out there?
What's your name?
Claire.
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
... yer ducts.
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
... new washer.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
You have materials for the side bearings?
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
A-flat, Majesty.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
I beg your pardon.
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
Go away!
On what side of the family?
His mother's side.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
No... No more killing.
Stay here.
Alex, please.
No no no no no no no no no...
This one.
How long've you been down here?
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
I don't think you're very polite.
You can't say that....
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Okay. We'll see you later then.
I think maybe we oughta...
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
I don't know, Jim...
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
Why would you want to be a cop?
Are you kidding me?
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
I own a brownstone on this block.
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
Yessiree, Bob.
...What was that back there?
Back where?
Sign.
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Yeah.
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
Don't drag my ass into this --
Good morning.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Nah, man...
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
What's that, sir?
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
Anybody can see that.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
What kind of trouble?
It's not closing, Mike.
That's impossible.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
What time did you make it for?
What's going on?
Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
We don't have much time.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Yeah.
Is that all you have to say?
What am I supposed to say?
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
Geez! You look great!
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
I don't like that story.
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
Right. Who called?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
...and you're going to do that?
Yes.
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
Just get on with it, Alex.
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
You heard about Carlton Fraser?
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
You didn't like them.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Would you sleep with them?
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Does it float?
What's the matter?
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
What did you say?
Who?
The Vice-President...
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
We have no use for your kind.
You know how improbable this is...?
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
That's right.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
Why did you come here?
So that others would know about this place?
Why should they?
Because it exists.
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
Hello, Rex.
Marylin.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
Let him gamble.
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
Whatever do you mean?
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
Why?
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
People have the right to know.
Well, there goes our record deal.
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
Coward.  Giving up.
Finally, we can bargain.
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Really?
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Oh...
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
What's so great about Sweden?
... no...
He's better off this way.
Nobody's better off this wav!
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
Where did you meet my father?
Who did you call?
What?
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
I called my dad.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Uh-huh.
You don't still think it was me?
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
What will they be made of?
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Silicon is from sand.
Who's that?
That's not
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
Was that supposed to be me?
No.
You all right?
Yeah.
Why're you crying?
Man, that's great.
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
Thirty-three--
Something wrong?
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Were there any calls?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
Oriental medicine.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Why does she come to you?
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click  click  click.
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches 
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
Safe journey.
You too.  Good luck!
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
Appropriate?
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Very well.
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
No.
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
That's...
...fine.
I ain't playin' that.
Jacques, you set a world record.
I did?
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
See does he want some.
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
What things do you think you've done?
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Don't bother.
You don't seem to understand.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Aren't you gonna answer that?
Answer what?
How big is the sub-basement?
Apparently it's huge.
I think I should come with you.
He's stubborn as a Stone.
I've been looking for you.
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Fuck you.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
Benes... What the devil happened?
The Other Side got to him.
How bad off is he?
Brain injury.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
My God, are you alright, Simone?
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
You lied at my trial.
I don't know you, man.
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!
Clench your teeth.
Wh... what... ?!
You must be my son.
Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
Where's the pinto going?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Where's Turley?
South of here, past Chimayo.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
I don't want to.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's not that.
What then?
It's stupid.
It's fun.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
Did you know Teresa Banks?
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
My Lord... what are your orders?
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Sir, may I --
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
I don't know what to do anymore.
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
And what of the Eloi?
They survived above.  Became what they are.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
Well, how was it?
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
She can fuck?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Did what take?
Yes!
Doctor Heller?
Yes!
It's me... Elizabeth.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Thanks.
How's your dad?
He's dead.
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
What do you mean?
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
Yes.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
Yes. On my torso.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
Well...um...her.
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
Civil?  I'm civil.
Go tell your father we're eating.
Dad's home, already?
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
It's important, sir!
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
Goodbye, darling.
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
Would you like a drink of water?
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Max--
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
You left out condescending.
But there's another side--
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
I'm the victim here.
Really?
Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
And you were a sympathetic ear.
Exactly.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Does this person have a name?
Lydia.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
I'm a toy to her.
A toy?
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
What happens if you level with her?
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
And why should she?
That's cuz I'm married to you.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
You just said he could eat anything.
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
What do you remember?
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Tell me.
What are you doing here?
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
Hello?
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Yeah, buddy?
Can you borrow me a dime?
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
You use their witness.
That's right.
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
No. Not at all,
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Not that I know of.
Groceries maybe? A package?
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Oh, I see.
Want to ask him?
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
I'm giving her a very high-class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.
Are you - giving a party?
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
I begged you to have a baby!
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
Theo wants to talk again.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is <U>important</U>. Understand? Important.
Big day today, huh? 78
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
Yes...
Are you sure?
Good-bye, Maxine.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
I didn't forget.
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
That was a really hot house!
So your name's not Gorsky.
...you did it.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
If only I could have been with you.
There were rats, Dad.
Rats?
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
They want my diary.
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
Why yes. How did you know?
My mother find you?
That's right.
Figures.
Want to tell me what went down here?
Racist asshole came at me.
Exactly what happened then?
I killed the motherfucker.
It won't come -- it's stuck.
What is it?
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
No! No reply. Remain on course.
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
How can you store an energy field within you?
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
That's where my father was killed.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
They use the Bogan Force.
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
I won't say good luck, Walter.
Why not?
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
It never happened.
What?
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
Yes, Sergeant?
Remember one thing.
Sir?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
Something I don't already know?
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Lili... I love you!
Where is he?
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink.
But what if...
Bill, how do you do?
Pleased to meet you.
[I don't know, I swear.]
[I believe you.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[Who's he?]
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
What'd you do, honey?
I said another man was buried in his place.
Where's Harry?
That's what we want to find out.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
I don't know.
Positive.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
Yes.
You told her I never said I love you before?
Yes!
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
Yes!
And you think she bought it?
I'm pretty sure she did.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
She bought it.
You hear that?
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Yes.
What is it?
You want --
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
Has he got your aunt's address?
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
You okay?
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Max?
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
Patch me through to him.
Justin.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
State your name, please.
Marvin A. Pickles.
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
Lisa, please!
There's nothing to see.
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
What are you getting at?
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
Yeah.
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Yes, I do.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
And who was the enemy?
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
May I come in?
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?
Not that tie with that coat.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
I'm still okay.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
He wants 75 back.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
Did you hear that?
I thought he would.
Now don't fuss, Paul.
What do you want to drink?
Sounds like professional jealousy.
Gotta go now, ma'am...
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
This has got to be a mistake.
I think you're drunk.
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.
Hey, Eve!
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
I certainly do!
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
No it's not!
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Go hard!
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Why not?
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.  The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
An invasion...
Where are we going?
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Good evening, sir.
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
We're letting them slide?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
But, Edward...
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Anybody we know?
Well?
This is fascinating.
Of course it is.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
I wrote that with my heart.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
I will not have it butchered.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
I don't know.
What month?
December twenty-first.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
Thank you.
I want you to do this work.
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
Better?
Read this, please.
Wait a second --
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
That's GREAT!
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
Fun -- look at that guy...
It's just the dope, don't worry
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
Why not? I need to get in there!
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
No no...
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
So who'd you hire?
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
The same.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
What?
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
Jesus Christ.
Is that him over there?
No.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
Did they...?
You understand?
Did they catch...?
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
Fletch.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Uh, almost.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
What if your parents come home?
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
He got in here how?
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Do you miss Mallory?
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Then was it worth it?
Was what worth it?
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
They're right here.
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Yeah. That was me.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
<u>Jake</u>...
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
Are you trying to insult me?
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Well, you shall see.
When is she supposed to return?
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Jesus.  Hello?
Hello.
Who is this?
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
If I could be of any help...
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
What do you know about obsession?
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
What's this stuff?
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
How's the patient.
Awaiting his arrival.
What about the cat?
Hildy!
Huh!
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
How much do you want on it?
All the words you've got.
What's wrong with Applejack?
He's having a heart attack or something.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
I missed you.
Yeah?...
--which Young?
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
Excuse me?
This is the end.
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
What's that?
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
I	know what a burrito is.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
What's inside?
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
Okay. I promise.
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
What is it?
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
What're you getting at?
If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
You knew. You just didn't care.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
Don't you mean what you do best?
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Do you have to wear that hat?
And more.
Why didn't you stop me?
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
That's what I like.
Which thing?
Either one.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
That's one way to put it.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
Miss Vivian --
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
Happy now?
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
Got a bogey, boss?
No --
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
Really Biff? The keenest?
Oh yeah.
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
No.
Good.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
What's wrong?
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
If they land--
Stan!
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
We're leaving them?
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
Why not just steal another one?
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
[Who pays you?]
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
It becomes an addiction.
Long wait for a bus?
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
Could be risky.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
Afraid of getting caught?
Maybe.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
I'm intrigued.
You're intrigued?
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
And if I didn't want to come?
I guess I'd ask you why.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
I want a firm commitment.
Thank you for coming.
Shut up and drive!
Hi.
The enemy is matching velocity.
What kind of assignment is that?
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
It's my Bullworker.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
What's gone?
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Oh, be still my heart.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
I like jazz ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Elvis I like, too.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
I told you.
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
Just went?
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
Call me on my cell if you go out.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Okay.
What's your friend's name?
Jack.
You love him?
Gas?
Gotta go.
Where?
Walter, what are you doing?
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Well I was uh, just looking...
Yeah. Big fan.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
No need to be modest, Brian.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
I have a job.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Buddy? ...
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
I don't want them to love me.
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
Don't look! Turn around.
I... I .....
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
I wanted to let his family know....
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
So...
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
You lost your mom...
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
Nice left you got there, jerk.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Take care of yourself out there...
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
Bill...
Huh?
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
I'll try.
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
And cut that out right now.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
What is that sup...
How's Brad?
A wreck.
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
Fools!
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
What do you want, Biff?
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
What do you want, Biff?
I don't want to be friends anymore.
Fine.
Beautiful.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
The name?
Where did you get this cauliflower?
From your office, sir.
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
I'm still asking myself--what is he-- animal, vegetable, or mineral? A Senator! A United States Senator! I thought I'd seen everything but-- why, he doesn't know what time it is, Diz! When I think of myself sitting around--playing straight for all that phoney, patriotic chatter-- *me*, carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists--no, I can't take it, Diz--I'm through--I quit!
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
What with?
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
Do it to ourselves?
We have to stick with the plan.
Tell us about it.
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Huh?
What you doing to my nephew?
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
What of it?
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
You're calling me a crank?
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
I think this is number three...
Nine meters.  Eight.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
So you're in?
Lloyd is doomed.
Meaning?
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
I have a brain.
This is kind of a cool place.
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Okay.
Good.
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.
You're leaving.
Food doesn't agree with me.
I'm leaving too.
Why?
This business is over.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
I'm just on vacation.
What kind of coffee do you like?
Huh?
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
Have I told you what this man did?				*
Yes.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Tell me about her again.
Why?
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
Rule of thumb?
Yeah?
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
What about witnesses?
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
Let's get inside.
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
Some of them have to be automatics.
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
What?
What night is it?
...Friday?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
I like calling you David.
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
Panes?
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
Why can't we?
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.
That was rather.... disappointing.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
If you say you are.
I most definitely say I am.
Cigarette?
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
About what?
Name something.
Then why go back now?
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Was I money?
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
She didn't see.
Are you ready?
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
It's like Samuel Beckett, you know- I admire the technique but he doesn't... he doesn't hit me on a gut level.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
That this was going to be a key party?
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
Well?
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
Damn it, Ben --
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
You're not going to --
I'm not.
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
The Big Hurt, huh?
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Miss me, Dave?
Cancer in a box.
How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
General Lee, sir!
What time have you, Gaston?
Eight forty-two, sir.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
I am, Gaston.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Have you?
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
No, sir.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
No, sir.
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
He might have hurt somebody.
How'd you know?
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fianc's in Palermo.
Oh, you --
Do you know me?
I'll go pay for my car.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
It's not bad, it's ok.
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
Do you believe in all of that?
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
What's your work?
I am... I was a pianist.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
No.
You look nervous.
What's happening?
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
I don't believe it.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
Confused?
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Oh, is that it!
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
Smitty.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Jesus. What are you doin?
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
That's too far ahead to plan.
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistresss brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.
You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
He did!
Now what do we do?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
All right.
She's going to leave you -
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Looks like we're it.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Can I get you anything?
Maybe a brandy.
Sure.
I'll be down in a minute
What?
Oh my god, It's real.
How 'bout a real drink?
We done?
Champagne?
I don't mind if I do.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
What did it cost?
Fifteen dollars.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
It's all I could afford.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
What's the matter?
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Maybe milking.
Milking?
Cows. You know, cows?
I've seen pictures.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
You're at Paul Owen s.
Who?
Paul Owen.
And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
I guess that means it's okay.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
You what?
This is all terribly wrong.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Are you afraid of me?
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Is this -- what?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
You can admit that, can't you?
Are you kidding?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Wait a minute!
On your first time --
Who said it was my first time?
That you're afraid --
Wait a minute.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
These for me?
...Tin Man!
We'll just be a minute.
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Ann ... Ann!
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
Getchmis olsun
Getchmis...?
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
You just got here....
Mrs. Leeman?
Huh?
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
You hated West more than any of us.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
You're the only one missing a grenade.
It's none of your business!
Where's Catherine?!
Praetor?
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
I'll tell you what...
Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
Charming Carlton.
You satisfied or you want more?
What is it with you, anyway?
Still think we're finished?
Not bad, Chris.
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Smythe, you've been drinking.
Do something.
What?
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Hey... don't knock librarians.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
What are you writing in that book?
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Just go!
Why is this?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Charming.
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
No, you don't! Walter!
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?
The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
And now, drum roll please...
What do you got there, Diego?
Nothing.  Just a little project.
What kind of project?
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
Twenty-six months.
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Daddy, did ya see that?
What?
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
Look, I showed you my badge...
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
The Department of Public Health...
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
They're liars and cowards.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
Dorothy Parker--
You like her?
I love the way she writes.
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Sure, why?
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
What?
Its wet. Will this do?
Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
My suitor?
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
He has proposed to me twice.
Damn. It's doing it again.
What's wrong?
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
When one sees you they all see you.
Shut up!
I can't let you take her out.
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
Huh?
If your duty requires it.
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
Why did you look at me that way?
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
Say something ...
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
Not really.
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
Thanks.
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
That's right, of course.
You really want to do this, don't you?
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
But you're his brother.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Sir?
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Try again.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Try again.
Sid, it's useless!
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
Tell me... what else did you have?
Well, a hat...
What was it like?
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
An evening gown.
Evening gown?
A dress you wear in the evening.
What do you wear in the morning?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Yes.
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
And there?
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
You feel it, though.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
What is it, Anna?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
You want this?
Just for the honeymoon.
Hey... Hey where are you going?
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Nah.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
So you're chicken?
I'll make it up to you.
How?
Would you remove your hat please?
Why?
I'll come to you tonight.
No, the children sleep with me.
Give them to Refugio.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
JUST SING!
Are you all right?
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
Guess I got a little scattered.
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
Aaronow...
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
What are we going to do with him?
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
That's not what I meant.
It's exactly what you meant.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
-- Permanently?
Be my friend.
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Godfather.
So why did you come back here, Sam?
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
You don't want to be Sheriff.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
You've got your mother, your kids--
I had to give some to Inez.
How much?
I like the freak show.
Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
...Well, I've got a large family.
How many kids do you have?
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
Eight children! 
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
That's amazing.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
I want you out now
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
Just passing through the night.
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
Yes.
What happened to you after ...
Your face ... are you hurt?
You like the ponies?
Sure. Yeah.
You bet the ponies?
Me? No. Not really.
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
Why?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
This one?
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
Pshhh...
A million. Easy.
She was fast, huh?
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
What is it?
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Then I'll leave thee.
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
Is that good?
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
How's the left these days?
What's it to you?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
Till 19-fucking-70.
You killed him -- didn't you?
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
You don't need anybody.
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
Sir Galahad!
Oh ... hello ...
Quick!
Why?
I see where Palantine got the nomination.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
My keys.
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
I hate fucking Springfield.
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
Murman!
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
You all put together?
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
Late for what?
Don't be dense. The party.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
And Flash isn't?
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
Thank you, sir.
Heineken.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
I'll need him.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
How'd you get here, Earl?
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
Why should I ?
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Why were you with him?
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
How'd you know where he was?
I found out.
And you didn't tell the Police?
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
This is my favourite place in the city.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
No.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Well.
You have been lonely?
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
An old man's dream.
... Can you... decipher this for us?
Decipher?
Yes. What do they... stand for?
They're just words.
Yes, I understand  but where do you take them from?
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
What are they?
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
What d'you think of the singer?
Nice voice.
Why would we want to do that, Nell?
Sure you do.
Maybe by now they are.
And ...your friend?
She's left.
Is she coming back?
No.
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
You still collect them?
Yes.
You don't have that one, do you?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
DADDY!!!
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
I'm not sure.
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
No.
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
No.  Not yet.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
How're you doing?
Fine. Just fine.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Yeah.
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
You've got to do something!
Who are they?
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
Well done, lad.
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
Utah?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
What about finding the source?
I have some ideas.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
You first.
Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
But wishes don't come true.
Certain wishes do.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
How?
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Is this paper even good?
Check the scrawl.
When's she out of here?
Truck.
Truck.  Of course.
'63 Chevy.
I knew it.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
"Escape"?
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
Why? Who are you?
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
No.
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
I don't remember.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Where does he hang out?
I don't know.
Where!
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
Because you're nuts.
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Coming?
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
Where's Mitch?
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Then he saw.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
A half hour in the lobby.
Mathilda? May I come in?
Get me out of here.
Where do you want to go?
Take me home.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
What are you then?
I'm alive.
Then what are you doing here?
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
What isn't happening?
Let me out of here!
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
It kind of looks that way.
Pistols?
Good morning. How's it going?
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
Get your own room, Ashley.
Nick...
I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
What happened? Is it over?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
He'll regret this.
Where can we meet?
Sing a song of sixpence...
A pocketful of rye...
You wouldn't understand.
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
What are you talking about?
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
Stay put!
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
-- Easy as that, huh?
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
That would complicate things.
Because I'd be to blame, right?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
He knows that?  Billy?
Yes.  He does.
Do we have to?
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
Howd you do this year, Tony?
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
Manifested?
That's a chimney swift, all right.
What on earth's the matter with you?
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Where are you going?
For a ride.
Wait, away?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
To his hotel?
I went out.
How ya doin'?
Can't complain.
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Is there a script?
It sounded like a bell.
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
Walter--
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
"Our" car, Walter?
How do you know who we are?
Everybody knows --
I didn't expect --
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Where you going to live, then?
At me friend's house.
Where's that?
Wilton Estate.
He'll learn.
Let's call that a start.
I can't do it.
You've just done it -
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
Will there be anything else?
You already asked me that.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
See about closing.
Yessir.
What time do you close?
Now. We close now.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
Is that what Argon told you?
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
You're afraid of him.
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
Mine!
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
Global warming?
What's he got?
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
I need your help.
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
I'm leaving.
Well?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
How's that?
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
No sound at all?
No, it was a table.
You see it?
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
No pistol. Ever.
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
Anything?
Nothing.
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Don't push it, Larry.
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Yeah.
Hell, good luck!
Good luck to you too, Paul.
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
I have a flair for drama.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
You wanted an answer to your question.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
You just go when I say go.
I don't believe this.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
What's my problem? You want a list?
What?
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
It's true. It's true.
Lois, I . . .
I was right. you are Superman.
Okay.
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
Fuck off, Barry.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Haven't seen it.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
Get in.  This side.
What?
Is that real enough for you?
It is for me.
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
Sustained.
California...
Live there?
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Wait a second--
Of course we are.  Of course.
Then you'll be my best man.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
What do you mean?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
I guess so.
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
Of course.
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Chef.
Yes, sir --
Why they call you that?
Call me what, sir?
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
A sauciere --
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
What are you doing out here?
Cook school -- that did it.
How?
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
What's your theory?
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
Floater?
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
What do you see?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
What?
Shall I go over there, sir?
My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds, before I find her.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
I totally, totally hate you.
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
Paul, are you there?
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Incredible.
Who?
My... husband.
I am husband?
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
I don't think, he can't...
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
What are you talking about?
You can do it, Sal.
No. No, no.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
I want to go home, Merle.
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
This is horrible!
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
Well... you see, the problem is --
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
What were you thinking?
Yum, yum.
I cursed.
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
Cabin fever, hon?
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
Maybe this is heaven.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
There aren't.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
Let's hear it.
The milkmaids.
Know the name?
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
There is one possibility.
Who are you?
He's the owner...
He's happy, darlin ..
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
I like it.  I like the idea.
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
It doesn't work on small animals!
Oh.
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
I can't
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
How d'ya like your room!
...Who is this?
Chet!
...Who?
Every entry was authorized.
Keep looking.
What're we looking for?
Stuck with what guy?
What?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
It's your birthday?
Yeah.
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
Lowell?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
Buff.
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
You're full of ifs.
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Yes..
What's that?
What do you want?
What is this?
They posted the next round of the tournament--
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Lila?
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Let them eat static.
They're still running with shields down.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
That's not what you said last night.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
My name is Gina!
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
What does old Stew want?
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
Who cares!
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
I'm educating myself!
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
is very angry.
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
Where's Ronnie?
Well I don't...
You cannot die.
Would that Marcus had lived.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
He killed his father and then my family...
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
Noooo!!!
Fucking Zombie.
The scar.
Dmitri didn't want the money?
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
Why?
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
Cheers Katka!
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
There she is!
Please!
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
Uh huh?
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
I've got to sleep.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
She could be telling the truth.
You've got big feet.
Yes.  Always have had.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
No.  What's that?
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
So you think we got 'em scared?
They're broadcasting...
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
I have a job.
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Whatever you want.
Fine!
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
I'll take this instead.
Help me get him to the boat.
No.
Michael?
I'm thinking about it.
Michael...
Carcharadon Carcharias.
That's it.
Okay, so that's it.
Is there one in these waters?
What makes you think there might be?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Probably.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
And sound.
Sound?
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
So there's one around here.
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
Pretty fast.
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
Enough?
Never enough.
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Wow!
Flash, get lost.
Tom, are you okay?
You try. You try talking to her.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
Don't ask me.
Tell me!
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
Can India help us?
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
Britain?
Britain chooses not to.
And, America?
America, we shall see.
Make us proud.
Sir, may I suggest --
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
Hi, kid.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
What's an Associate Producer credit?
Your friends are late...
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
Baines is packing up?
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Why now, Jimmy?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
What... what do you mean?
How old are you?
Eighteen.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
What do you want?
Conklin.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
What are you doing here?
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
Last year? It can't be that long.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
We was worried about you, Cease.
Me?  Why?
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
Thank you.
There's more!
I think that's it.
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Colorful, isn't he?
You going to be all right?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Go on, ask them.
Who are you?
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
You can't have them. Go to hell.
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
So howsit?
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
Oh, man, there you go again.
What?
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
Are we going to sleep now?
That's right.
Can we dream?
The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
"You could be swinging on a star."
What's the running time?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
Wow. You're something.
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
What do you think happened on this boat?
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
The what?
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Well, may we have a look around?
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
Uh-huh.
Any idea where I might start looking?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
All you want is a phone number?
Well, I know you're busy...
Don't play games with me, Ted.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
I don't buy it.
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
I don't know...
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
Yes?
My name is Travis.
You mean it's a girls' band?
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Why?
Here.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Can I come in?
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
...junk!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
Quiet!
I'm nearly out.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Close enough to beam down?
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
Did you learn anything?
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Did you talk to him?
What's wrong ?
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
We gotta hook up.
Sure. Where?
P.J.'s.
Make a list.
We need milk....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
We need beer....
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Excuse me, sir...
It's time we lock coordinates.
Not.
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Chances of recovery?
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Valerie?
Are you dead?
No.
What are you doing?
I think I'm floating.
Why would you be floating?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
You're hurt...
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
What about her?
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Tell me about the purity.
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
I'm sure we will.
Describe Mallory.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
That's indescribable.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Says who?
Says the United States of America.
Well? Is it just the pump?
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
This is pretty good. Considering...
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
...yes -- oui -- uh...

Paris?
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
-- sir? --
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
I want it --
He lied to me
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
Would you like a drink?
Yes, please.
What'll it be?
It's tight.
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
Okay, okay.
At least somebody likes this shit.
Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
Some of what?
Extract of pineal!
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Right!
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Yes!
Really?
What the hell is it?
Burn her anyway.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
But that's not true! I've got one.
...Are you a tranz or a rez?
Excuse me?
Transient or resident?
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
He didn't do it!
What?
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
Five thou.
What? What is it?
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
They're ready now.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
Sir... have you a name?
Flynn!!
Greetings, program...
You're alive!
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
Stand up.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
You didn't tell us you had this on!
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
What?
Enzo?
What?
Your mother?
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
Who are you?
I am the Borg.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
There are soldiers.
Where?
What happened that night?
You promised you'd never ask me.
Then why didn't they take it.
How long do you think you've been here?
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
How could I ever leave?
How long is this going to go on?
What?
It was very dark.
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
Vous tes Franais?
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
Sure. By shooting at me.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
I don't even know your name yet ...
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
A page-break signal.  A period.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
Mike?
What?
My ass if falling.
Your what...?
My ass is falling.  It is.
What are you talking about?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Get in bed.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
Damn... damn... damn...
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
I just pulled and it - it came off.
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?
I feel good.
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
What's up, Ray?
Claude.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
What do you want, Claude?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
You still got that map?
Yeah.
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
On your behalf. What happened to we?
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
That's an affirmative.
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
You gave them me.
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
The lockdown thing.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
-- it wasn't me.
Rewind that.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
Then who did??
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
It works.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
What else could it be?
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
What did you just say?
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
So. Is he any good?
No. Not yet he isn't.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
He is. Take my word for it.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
And you struck him right here in our house?
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
Amazing.  Where are we?
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
Too late.
What?
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
You mean you heard them making love?
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
Where's the walk-in safe?
Behind you.
What's the combination?
Stantz?  You okay in there?
Where did you sleep?
I didn't.
I hope the block is still standing.
You can tell by the intonation.
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
John.  My name is John.
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
I'm sure they're around.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
Of course.
You won't forget it?
I won't forget.
Do you hear anything?
Only silence. It's always like this.
And no birds sing.
No birds live here.
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Sophie.
You sonuvabitch.
Wuddya got for me  what the hell happened to your face?
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Well I...
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Tell him to put his gun down!
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
We had feared we were the only ones...
Forget it, it'll never work.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Ready, Kringelein?
Yllo, what's your head count?
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Why do you say that?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
He means the last that we know of.
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
Are you saying they won't help us?
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
We're locked into Albania.
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
I lost him.
How?
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
Louis, please -- !
Okay?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
I want to see Brad.
Can I use the car tonight?
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
Let it go.
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
Took it this morning.
He needs a haircut.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
You can change.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
Yeah.
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
You like that?
Very much.
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
Anya!
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
What about that ugly dog?
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
The turkey in?
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
What's going on, Harry?
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
How you doing, sweetie?
I'm scared.
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
Terry, you're bleeding.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Terry, for God's sake.
Get out of my way.
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
You alright...?
I want to hear the truth.
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
What?
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
Have it your way.  The point is--
It's your roll--
The fucking point is--
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
It couldn't have been earlier?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
Mom?
Yes?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
I won't make any noise.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
That's what Tim said.
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
Would you mind repeating the question?
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
You do?
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
The Vice Squad?
That's right, Baxter.
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
What kind of joint are you running?
Sir?
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Who?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Oh.
Are you going to deny it?
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
You better.
Oh, there you are--
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Yes, he is.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Stop it.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
I'm not.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
You're ruthless.
Have her come up.
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
Sven!
Horseshit.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
Do you really want this, Dick?
This.  Above all.
What's funny?
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
Jeff, stay there.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
You speak English!
A little.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
It's the same thing!
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
We are both full of shit.
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
But I haven't . . .
Oh, brother.
I aimed high.
What points?
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
Are you giving me orders?
I'm sorry, I --
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
A statement? Good.
I have it here.
No, please, I don't --
You fight it cut.
So, how many people live here now?
I don't know, eight or nine.
Where does everyone sleep?
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
I don't want to hurt Charley I don't want to hurt you...
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
I know what you want me to do!
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
That  word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
Mein Kampf?
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
What is she shooting?
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Alex you can't -just leave.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
I don't care.  I hate him.
You don't hate him.
I'm sorry what I said back there.
Don't be silly.
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
You ask her!
Oooh, this smells terrible.
A gold mine?
Was the trip okay?
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
How can he not have a heartbeat?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Hello?
Hello.
What time does the bus leave?
What bus?
Yours.
I'm scared, mama.
Why, honey?
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
We'll figure out something.
I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
How?
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I don't understand.
Perfect!
I didn't see you at the reunion.
I've been busy.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
Since Nancy died.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
What's that?
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
It's embarrassing, okay?
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Can't we at least talk about it?
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
Nothing?
We been through that.  Forget it.
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
You jump, I jump, right?
What the hell's going on?
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Hurt!  How?
All right then.
What are we doing down here?
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
No, she was heavily sedated.
It's serious?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
When will you do it?
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
I dunno.
What's your specialty?
Whips...orange whips.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Uh...over easy.
Geez, they look kinda weird.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Go ahead.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
All summer?
What do you want to do?
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
Whatiya mean?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
What do you want?
I want you to hurt me.
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
You've heard of me?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
What report?
Huh?
What report?
You mean you don't know?
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
You can't go. Call them back.
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
You lie, motherfucker...
Bingo.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
Howdy.
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
If he had his blinkers on--
I don't think so.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Yeah.
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Stop fighting and get out.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
I thought you were gonna throw these?
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Destroy the evidence huh.
Have you ever stolen anything?
Nope.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
Like helping a sick kid?
No, for the Asylum.
Close!
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
It's true!
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
Don't you know it!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
What did He say?
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
I feel very good in here.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
I'll take you.
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
Catherine told me what was in it.
If she's telling  you the truth.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
Indy! Help me!
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Is he for real?
Anybody else?
Do we get to wear a crown?
But of course.
Count me in.
Lie face down on the floor.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
We got this far.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
Sailor? You know what?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
May I speak freely?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
How could it not?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Come on now.  People are smart.
I'll go with you.
Could you play ARCADE with that?
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
What about Customs?
I'll worry about Customs.
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
What's he smoke in that?
So you'll be at work?
We believe we have a suspect.
What a relief.
Coffee's perked.
When did she die?
Did you see that?
What?
I don't know. Something.
A deer?
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
Ay, yi, yi, yi.  The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
See -- you can drive after all!
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
You were late.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
You want to go talk to him?
Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
What do you mean? What's going on?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Thanks.
I thought it was appropiate.
Is that good or bad?
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
How so?
So...does it hurt?
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
For real?
I got an awful toothache.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
I heard.
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
Do you have any kids?
Claire!
I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
An empty tomb?
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
Strange. I know so very little about you.
Think I got 'em?
I don't know.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
Of course.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
I have a tiny apartment.
Yeah, I know it's small.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
You don't want me to live with you?
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Mine.
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
I'm scared shitless.
He can pilot?
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
Who?
Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
We won.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
You didn't step on any mine.
I heard it click.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
What's wrong?!
And how do we do that?
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
-no Cheesy Poofs.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Goodbye, Grady.
No. Sara, you don't understand...
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
Yea?
What does that mean?
No!
I'm sorry, John.
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
I have to go away, John.
I've got to stop.
What was that all about?
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
I didn't get it either.
What the Hell's going on?
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
You like him, don't you?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  That my drugs had gone through.  What would have been the harm?  A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive.  We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?
You're breaking my heart.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
So go shower already.
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
Atomic fuel?
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
What?
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Good way to lose your job.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
Who the fuck is it to you?
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
Would somebody fill me in?
Burt!  Heather!
Yeah, Val.
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
Don't point it at James!
You the owner here?
That's right.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
All right if I look around your lobby?
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
Which loser?
You know, the green cardigan guy.
Were you born in Mexico?
Cuba.
You talk too fast.
I have some very good memories there.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Where do you go next?
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
Pretty much what you'd expect.
We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
It means shut up, Thelma.
Come on boys, don't be shy.
Hurry it up.
Oh my God!
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
No... You come back to me Louis...
I think you were worried about me.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
Don't forget you have your brother.
Yeah.
You were late.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
You want to go talk to him?
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
Doing what?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
He'd assume we had.
That's something I suppose.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I'm glad.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
I know.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
Who are you talking to?
Where'd he go??
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Nothing?
You like gymnastics?
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
I still have your virginity!
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
No...
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
You didn't?
On account of Mitch?
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Really?
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Said "looks clear."
Well, what's it look like now?
What are you trying to do to me?
We want to help...!
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
... your one chance for true happiness?
... yeah, that.
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
There's no other choice.
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
Oh, no.
Hey, we're connected.
Great.
Great?
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why don't you let at do that...?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Doctor's orders- - -?
I've been waiting for you, baby.
What's the pumpkin for?
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
Thanks.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
I want Debbie.
Cole...
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Five thousand dollars.
What?
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
No. No, you don't.
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
Are you following me?
Well, I...
That's impossible.
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Captain, what have I done -
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
You're joking.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
I'm gonna nail it.
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
I pay my own way.
Martini!
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
Well you're not reading it right!
I like your car.
Thanks.
Where'd you get it?
Interested in buying one?
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.



Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
Oh --
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
What about you?
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Szpilman.
Y-yes.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
Millions - if anybody wants it.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Can I go?
Keep the change.
It's got a bottom.
I was getting to it.
Are these not the answers you came for?
Yes... My God...
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Any news of Quaid?
Not since you lost him.
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
Uh-oh...
I'll remove him.
I'm not going without you.
Don't take it personally.
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
What do we do?
Yeah.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
My God, what in hell happened here?
Dad?  About last night?
It's never happening again. Right?
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
He got lucky.
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
No, you were brilliant
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I don't know, I'm afraid.
How did they get in here?
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
What other food?
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
Money.
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
This is crazy!
What is?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
What?  What is it?
Were upside down!
You're crazy. We're level.
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
Damnit, where's my car!
That's where you live.
I'm at your service.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Why didn't you bury those people?
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
Is he serious?
Always.
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
He did? When?
While you were in the shower.
Why didn't you call me?
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
What? What do you mean?
He said you didn't have one.
What's he talking about?
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
I don't believe this.
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
... just like the mouse.
Mouse?  What mouse?
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
What happened to it?
I'm very sorry --
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
No one will believe us.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
That's a good one.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
Cy... I ain't even sure.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Naw... I gotta...
I hate having my picture taken.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
Hey, Diz...
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
I tried that already.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
No proof?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What do you mean?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
Who's your candidate?
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
What about Jorgensen?
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
For what?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
But you was going to fight for me.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
How old are you?
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
I made no deal!
I don't buy that.
I wanna go home!
Yeah, it's cold!
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
You doing okay?
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Foreman now.
No shit.
Five years.
Beautiful. How's business?
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
An unholy trinity ...
You killed my husband.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Too many cooks --
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
But -- why?
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
I'm okay.
Agent Desmond, it's...
It's late, Sam.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
For the money.
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Hey, Mick!
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Well, you can't always get what you want.
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Good on ya, man.
You make videos?
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
You could do it.
I could.
Yeah!
Yeah.
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
Yes!
Yeah!
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
You all right?
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
What's your name, boy?
Walter Livesy.
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
One hour!
Drew!
I guess you saw the show...?
Which show was that?
Sofie...
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Spaceship of some kind.
I'm not making it up.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
How long have you been here?
Three nights.
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Two or three nights.
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Are you going to be all right?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Take good care of yourself, okay?
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
You just feel sorry for me.
Can't do it.
Sir...?
You shot Roger.
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
La da da dalala...
I hate fuckin' opera.
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
You're soft.
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
Months, Swana.
Maybe one of the original crew?
No. It was someone else.
Who?
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
You liked it there.
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Learning was important?
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Did you have fires at night?
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
It must have been safe.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
You need to call your dad.
Leave us alone right now.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
Aye, ma'am.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
You've been there?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You believe that?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
No charge.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
Two-hundred.
What?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Yeah, but it was shot.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
What sign?
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
Yes, well...
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
No, really.
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
I might still have a few chips left.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Other way around, sir.
Oh, is this your father?
No. My uncle.
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
Weiss.
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
What about the sender?
Hello, Jane. Its me.
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Carlos De Moraes?
Yes. How did...
Was it a boy or a girl?
Mike, at three and a half...
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
It was a boy.
And Kay...she's all right?
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
You're a thief?
Girl's gotta make a living.
Thank God.
First time I ever heard that.
I was expecting someone else.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Where was the last place you left him?
Right here in the van.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
I'll be in to read you a story.
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share.

The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
I'm cool.
The sewers.  Of course.
Hurry!
Smoke !
I could be gone for years.
I know.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Are we going to argue?
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
Okay.
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
No, I know that part --
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
A sense of humor.
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
It's right in front of us.
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
What you doin', son?
Are you or aren't you?
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
C4, plastic explosive.
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
Hey Butt-Head it's that chick!
Disappointed.
She never told Eddie, though.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
How'd you manage that, then.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Modelling.
Hi, Dad.
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
That was a beautiful message.
I meant every word of it.
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
Doesn't sounds like him.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
Why are we doing this?
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
What?
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
You mean...and orgasm?
You got it, stud.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
But that one time --
No.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Do you?
Of course.
What on earth?
Any ideas?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Is that written in his shoe?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
Finished, son?
And your hand too.
Something short.
Sharp.
Snappy.
With a little jazz.
The Shazzammeter!
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
Kay-Em we made it!
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
Good idea... kill me.
Dude. Seriously?
What's wrong with it -- ?
How'd you know where I'd be?
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Nasty.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
And what was that?
You're hurt.
I'll be fine.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
Because it's my name.
Then who's Russell Nash?
You don't know how good it is to see you.
I'll bet he never jerks off...
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
H-how long will it take?
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
But not tonight.
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
The van?
Is it your vehicle?
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
You are very kind.
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
You're a beautiful woman.
Thank you.
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
I have a cold.
What did the thermometer say?
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
If you must know, virtually nothing.
How many men are working with you on this?
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
That's all you've had all this time?
Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
I thought so.
Is he in an asylum?
He's dead.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
You ol' fucker!
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
Fucking sweet.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
How do I know their voices are --
Where we going?
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
Yeah?
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
We think so.
Mmm.
Mmm, what?
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
How long?
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
Maybe she used another name.
This is my good John Brown.
Yes.
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
Where am I gonna start?
You know that gal?
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
'Bout every other night, Red.
A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
We'll send a squad up.
No need, everything's under control.
With four casualties?!
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
Most every day.
Gettin' old, huh?
Two negatives always make a positive.
Guess what?
I give up.
Remember this...?
Where's LUH?
Oh, many things...
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
But I gave it to you!
Well what am I gonna do with it?
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Yeah.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
In Group?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Intense.
How long were you in there?
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
People said she looked like me.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
Which is shit.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
I'11 find him.
Waste of time.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
What?
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
Well, they will be.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
How awful.  What will you do?
For what?
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. 
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
And if you don't?
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Would you like me to go for her?
I couldn't ask you to.
I don't mind, really.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
What are you doing?
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
You're going hunting?
What?
And what ritual would that be?
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
And how does one do that?
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
Oh yes, of course.
And then killing your sister.
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
You should.
A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
What's that all about?
We thought a doctor might help.
Your old beau?
We thought it was an emergency.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
We all are.
Shouldn't you lie down?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
Deadline?
Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
Do you want to come in?
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
She's not a tart.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
What are you getting at, Professor?
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
Where? Where is she?
I'm not telling.
What?
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
Fuck you, Phil.
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
So-so, Johnny.
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Right.
It's still available I hope?
I think it's still available.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
They're dead?
Yes they are.
Stiffs??
Deceased.
Maybe I missed you too....
What?
I just had a phone call.
Tell me, is it bad news?
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
I won?
On the bed!
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
Oh hey, one more thing?
What's that?
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
My pleasure.
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
I thought you were in a good mood.
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Don't you like her?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Then what's the problem?
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
What're you talking about, George?
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
The killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue, doesnt want to see you take over...
Thats every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.
"Out."
"Of love?"
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Sorry...
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
Believe what?
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
I didn't know that.
Still champions.
They're turning around.
What's wrong with him?
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Honest to God, Ruben!
I like women like that!
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
Yes, Mr. Dowd.
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
Now we can do whatever we want.
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
Excuse me?
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
What are you talking about?
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
I didn't say it like that.
You <u>did</u>, you--
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
I think about that night a lot...
Me, too. Every time I walk...
This is the Nexus?
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
How long...you think?
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
When did he go off chemo?
About three weeks ago.
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
Uh. huh.
I'm really sorry.
He's in here --?
My window - - through which I see the world.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --
Look, look at that guy.
M'hm.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
Don't hit me.
I want somethin' sweet.
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
Do we have to talk about this?
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
You lying son of a bitch...
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
Please, go ahead.
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
The one and only.
Doc eat already?
What can I do for you, lad?
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk?  About what?
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Why not, Bobby?
I admire them.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Edith was just telling me about her job.
I'm a file clerk.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
She's from Cuba.
I'm the King of the World.
Are you getting out much?
No.
Following the game at all?
No.
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
Well, I need that...
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
Now why'd you go and...
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
How'd you know it was us?
It's outta here!
Hi.
Hi.
Weir is dead.
Then who the fuck are you?
What!?
I said, yeah, about once a week!
And you?
I didn't dive.
You'll try again tomorrow?
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Where's my daughter?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Drop that fucking money!
No Jean, no money!
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
What?
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
I don't think so.
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
...the Copa, in New York...
Wait 
Mmm ... what are you doing?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
No sweetheart, you can't.
Why not?
He was allergic to bees.
He's okay isn't he?
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
You know better than that.
We don't know of anything, Master...
Then why do you shake so?
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Oh God. This is insane.
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
You're serious.
Quite.
Then the rumors are true?
What rumors might those be?
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
I see you got the telegram.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
What?
Dude, this is all I got.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
Who's Eichmann?
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
Homicidal?
You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
Dr. Thompson...?
And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.
I have always loved him.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
He was with Gruner!
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
Tower, here.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
What am I doing here?
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
Give it back.
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
Excuse me?
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
I didn't strain. I sighed.
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
I don't think so.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
They are not.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
I don't know...
What about that other guy?
Other guy?
We must follow that bird.
Whatever for?
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Beware.
Shall we let the people come in?
You got any kids?
How do you know my name?
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
And what is your name?
Phoebe.
Phoebe?
I call myself Phoebe.
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
What is this place?
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
Your suit, Becky!
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
Very good, sir.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
You think of everything, don't you?
So this is what, a test?
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
Bob...
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
He's only doing what you told him to.
What I told him to?
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
Go away, Nosey.
Let's keep her.
You're better than I expected.
I was at Harrow ...
They only kill them when they love them?
I don't even know how much money that is.
How much you got to see the show?
Suzie???
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
...I'm sure you do...
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
...I know. I went...
...You saw her?
Yes. Yes, I have.
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
...fifty thousand dollars?
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
...I understand...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
...I understand...
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
It's not safe for you to be either.
So, it's from the future, is that right?
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
And you're from the future too?
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
And we intend to use them!
Jordan...
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
You've what?
She's just outside the door.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
Where do I charter a boat?
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
What?
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
So what's the problem?
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
That's a good idea.
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
I doubt it.
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
I don't think you will.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
Where have you been?
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
You're goin' on a trip?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
You should go on a trip.
No thanks.
So what should I do with the pudding?
Marty...
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
He's heading under -- !
Where are we?
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
You won't die if you let me help.
Bullshit!
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
I promised to protect her from people like you.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
She'll never understand it.
In time, she will.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What happened today?
What are you talking about?
Was it something that happened at school?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
How many you see?
One or two.
They couldnt climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
Lloyd, be careful...
Where does Dickie live?
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
What?
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
How much?
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
So?
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Why'd you drop out?
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
There is nothing we can do...
I'll need to know more about this thing.
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
Defense against what?
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
Where did you find that?
I liberated it.
I think that's called looting.
Does it work?
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
So?
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
Come on up!
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Which means he probably knew her.
Oh...
Well, how did you like the class, David?
You still interested in that?
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
You're not allowed to ask that.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
You got me.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
You're WHERE?
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
No.
I mean if you knew karate?
No Jeremy.
Early, just think...
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
I always wanted to try that.
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
Can I come out?  No.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Can I come in for a minute?
What?
Good.
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
I don't want to learn.
You don't want to learn.
No.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
All right - so what do we do now?
How are you?
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
Sure. What do you want to know.
People say he was a murderer.
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
I can't believe he'd do this.
Okay, a blur.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
I know.
If you went away, what would become of me?
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
I can't help it.
No.
Oh, my, yes.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Hello?
Gale?
She's not here right now.
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
There's just one question.
Of course.
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
It's my daughter! Go after her.
My lady!
Who is there?
My dear President...  read it back...
"My dear President"...
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
"My dear"...
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
"My President"...
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
"My"...
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
"My dear"...
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
"My dear President"...
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Is that all?
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
No.
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
And she got the medium.
Thank you.
Who the fuck is he?
Jimmy.
It's him, isn't it?
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Why, are you famous?
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
How many was that?
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
That's funny.
I thought so, too.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
No, you didn't.
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
Who makes all these?
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
I know you didn't
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
Doesn't that scare you?
No.
Why?
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
Dunn.
Sir?
You must be the new tenants.
Where are you going?
Hunting.
When?
Sun up.
Alone?
No.
Ramn -- you can't.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
You mean you're ready to give up?
I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
Yeah, Kay?
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Noon exactly.
Did he say where?
Actually, yeah--
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
How'd you know that?  Kay?

Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
How much longer for the range and power projections?
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
You made your decision yet?
I'm leaning toward no.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
He's trying.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
Somebody did that to him.
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
Monsieur. Quel numero.
I don't know which numero.
The fat man down there, on the bench.
I heard you were looking for this.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Not much, I think.
I'm just like him.
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Did you worry about him?
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
Howdy, Rhonda.
You're really leaving, huh?
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
Didn't you tell her?
Seventeen minutes.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
Why?
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
Nobody's asking you to.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
I sat outside and had coffee.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Near the church.
They hurt you!
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
What I mean is --
We're a team.  We work together.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
Are you here?
I'm here.
Because you don't really seem here.
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Something's up wi...
Go on.
Jamie!
Luke.
You better dust this place, Sam.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
Who cares ?
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
Mummy!
STUFF.  Got a light?
Four minutes ago.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
Yeah? What do you want?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
I haven't broken any laws.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
I would.
Got something to hide?
Doesn't everybody?
I could get a search warrant.
I really want that watch.
This isn't right.
You fool, you fool.
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
As close as a deal could be.
No.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
To check up on me?
I'll be around to check up on you.
Why would you be there?
Because I live there.
We shall want a full autopsy ...
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
Do you know him?
Yep.
Where does he live?
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes, but where?
Right across the bay there.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
So can I come along?
You ain't coming to work?
The number's unlisted...
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Okay, okay. You're right.
You look a little old for a student.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
She never mentioned her father.
You're going to burn up in those.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
With one of them.
Ill send someone out.
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
I told you, that's a secret.
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
Where?
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
Benjamin Franklin High School.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?
I think I'm a werewolf.
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
Becker does? Are you sure?
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
What's her name, anyway?
Is it real?  You people are sick.
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Maybe I dont.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
Kristina's fine.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Yeah.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
Jack.
Let's get it over with.
Yeah, so?
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
Do you see a man?
No.
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
But would you--would you--
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
Marco...
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
But Rache...
Sophy?  Are you okay?
Mommy, where are you?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
When?
Soon, baby.
Mommy, I'm scared.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
What is it?
I think you'd better go.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
Eliminate the competition.
Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
My troops don't make policy.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
Yeah.
He'd want to know about all this.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
Shall we go?
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
No thanks.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
Cool, huh huh huh.
Scully...
Scully, I found the bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
Where's Dr. Marcus --
What the?...
Hello?
It's Elvis...
Who?
It's me...
... How did you get into marine salvage?
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
Wait'll you see the inside!
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Never better.
Besides --  "Takes a man to do something like that."
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
Yes, I do.
Nautilus?
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
285.
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
What's that?
A-14.
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
What -- you don't have the medallion?
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
I'll watch my back.
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
That's right.
And what did your team do...
Well, we...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
Yes.
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...We did everything we could...
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
Yes!
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
Electricity.
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
We're there.
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
You drive like a maniac!
I call this the staccato. 
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
Oh yeah?
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Refresh my memory.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Maybe I blocked it out.
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
Don't! Just let go.
It's better, Mary Sue.
I terrible with mechanical things.
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
And if I say yes?
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Not yet.
Who's the other one?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
What's her story?
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
And splittin' with her?
I'm sure that was the idea.
What did you say?
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
She told you that?
Uh-huh.
Was she there?
She didn't say.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Uh-huh.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
I am listening, my son.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
What are you saying?
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
I'll take the parasites.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
I want brain parasites.
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
I want that.
You can't have the whole brain!
So far, you have four and I only have two!
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
Who are you?
The Daddy-Oh!
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
You might not have done it had you known.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Fifteen years?
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
I don't understand.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
How?
What does it say?
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
It's not me, it's my wife.
What is?
I told you.
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Professor Tripp...?
Yes, James.
Will these boards hold?
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
Uh-huh.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Copy.
We've got a -
Somewhere in between.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
What?
That's not why we're here.
Say ... about the interest ...
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
You crying?
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
<u>Yeah</u>!
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
Who tied her down?  You or him?
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
Tonight?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
They're nervous, sire.
How come you took your own car?
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Well that's something.
What is.
I'll have to pay him back.
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
I'm not even listening.
Damn it!
I didn't even see them fire!
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
I'm making a mess.
This I can see.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
What happened between you and the blonde?
What?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
Darn it!
You okay?
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
Have either of you seen David Watts?
Well... where is he?
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
You think it was poison?
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
...in the morning.
And if you're wrong?
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
How often do you go?
Good night, Daphne.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
Transitioned?
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
Where was the call from.
Somewhere in Italy.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
Gasparilla?
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
It's not about working hard --
Bullshit.
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
What?!
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
Maura.
Maura.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Feeling better now?
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Transparent aluminum?
That's the ticket, laddie.
He certainly has your number, Alan.
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
I get real busy between two and four.
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
I want my pills NOW!
It'll only take a second.
What do you think of this one?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Me?  Why me?
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
That was Nancy, not me!
What are you doing?
To the limit.
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
Like...?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
No.
Zack, we've got to go.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
Bombers.
- could take weeks, sir.
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Yeah...?
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
What's she saying?
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
What's that?
Powerful warrior.
...You know what I mean?
No, don't tell me  you just got fired by your crazy boss.
I guess you did.
Guess I just got sick of him.
Can I walk you home?
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Yeah.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
What the hell you doing back already?
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Well...yeah--
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Well yeah...I know that.
So Dieter has the money?
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Do you still have that doctor's number?
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
Richard, I had to see you.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Please.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
No. I'll do them later.
Francesca?
What?
Are you all right?
Yes.
Francesca?
What?
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Elroy.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Mommy...
Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!
How're the cameras doing?
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.  We move out in two-zero mikes. 
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
Yes?
Yes?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
From Miss Johnson --
What good is this?
He comes over to study.
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
They'll never stop.
I love you.
They ruined me tonight.
Moved on to plumbing huh?
You provoke me, Merlin.
What's the matter, Norma?
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
We've missed you too, dear.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It's a good script, isn't it?
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
It's that woman from the coach!
Whose shoe?
Susan Lefferts.
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
What the... ?!  What was that for?
Follow me.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
We miss you. We miss our son.
What the hell are you doing?!!
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
What happened? How far did you get?
So, another one bites the dust.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
We tried.
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Then what good is he?
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
Is that a problem?
Not for you, clearly.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Am I a thing?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
I'm not.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a knock.
It's not a compliment.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
As soon as you get dressed.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
Why?
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
Like you.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
My angel!
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Yes sir.
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
Hi.
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
I...
Honey ...
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Honey ...
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
Who hired the bastard?
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
Like what?
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
... Alright.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
I'll match any man with the sword.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
No, thanks.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Christine what?
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
You picked her up on the ferry.
I didn't know her.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
Think she might've run out on you?
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
You from around here?
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
You here for the summer?
Some friends and me took a house.
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
Where does that go?
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
People still watch that?
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
It's not for sale.
What the hell are you doing?!?
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
Hostile?  Me?  Thelma, I'm not hostile.  I am anything but hostile.  But if you want to know what I am.  I'll tell you what I am. What I am is, I am hurt.  I am very hurt.  And I just want to know one thing, okay?  Just one thing ...Why?  That's all I want to know...Why?
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
Things? What kind of things?
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
What's that, sir?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Ah... pity, pity...
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
Yes sir. Negative effect.
What was that, Doolittle?
Negative effect.
It didn't work?
That's correct, sir.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
I know what you mean.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
Ill just check into a hotel.
Have you evacuated anyone?
Only that floor.
Is the hostage injured?
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
That's right!
Where did it come from, Mama?
He's gone. He stole the car.
Where was it parked?
It's on.
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
And what did they say?
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
What is it?
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
How did you know?
You still there?
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
It's been totally charted.
We just talked.
Sure.
1000.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
No, I'm not...
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
I can't.
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
When's your next round?
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
Oh...
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
What?
What?  Where?
There's always a chance they'll confess.
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
Mr. Abraham...
Abrams...
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
I'm fine.
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
Yes.
Girlfriend?
Yes.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
I might not be able to.
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Oh dear....easy honey...
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Good.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
You're a thousand percent right!
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
You know it, Lilly.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
You deserted me.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
You're the one who started running.
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
Are you so certain you are away from it?
As far away as I ever want to be.
What do you do that for?
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
Goodbye, Kundun.
I suppose so.  Yes.
And charming?
I've never given it much thought.
I love that youre asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
Josie, you look Rufus.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
Why are you on to him?
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Why'd you invite me here?
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
What about the others.
What else did he tell you?
A drink with an umbrella in it....
A big one....
What's that?
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
How long will the effect last?
About ten minutes.
Ten minutes...
How are things going, pal?
Okay, I guess.
How about dinner tonight?
Mom and I got plans.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
She's taking singing lessons.
She's what?
A "complimentary corsage."
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
...somebody...
Hey, you didn't pay me!
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
You're such a baby.
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
I like to laugh, Fred.
That's why I married you.
Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
And where is the army?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
And who is defending Paris?
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Blacks welcome there?
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
How could this be happening?
I don't know.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
Sun spot?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
Can I say something, here?
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Lemme alone...
The infamous dog?
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
Ours.
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
And look at this, Doctor!
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
No.
Do I need to repeat myself?
George... how about Felicia?
What?
Did you?
Did I what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Hey, I don't tell.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Yeah?
Who is this?
Maintenance.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Very good, Sir.
Excuse me?
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
You told me you'd say that.
Abort the plan.
You told me you'd say that, too.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
I know.  Thank her for me.
What's bothering you, Madison?
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
What, I couldn't hear you?
This must have been in the family a long time.
She looks tired.
I call. What you got?
Three bullets! Any good?
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Where do you think you're going?!
What are you going to do?
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
No.
So beautiful!
So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Or a vampire.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
What have I done?
Now, how are we gonna do this?
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
Terry Valentine.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
Cal, too?
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Anyone else?
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't.
Don't push me away.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Don't do this.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
Don't do this!
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
You changed your mind.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
I'm thinking.
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
Set!
Now!
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
It's just you and your dad, right?
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Sure I do.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
How long will you be?
It's almost ten o'clock.
Daddy you scared me!
You're grounded Friday night!
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
It's not that... it's not that...
What do you mean?
It's not my time of month.
Should you see a doctor?
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
For what?
I don't know... I don't know...
Scottish?
Why do they care about our maps?
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
There...Ya happy?
No.
Why?
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
Cool it, Choco.
When could I look round?
Hello, Cassius.
All right. Let me out.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
James...
I have to go.
Then take me with you.
No. Youll be safe here.
I dont want to be safe!
You got your own nightclub?
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
You say that because you have the title!
No!  I would never cheat you.
Where's your dad?
Said he'd be home later.
Later when?
Well, isn't it?
I... suppose so, yes.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
What can I do?
There is something I want.  A friend.
Friend?
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
And if I consent?
Oh, I'll get 'em all.
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
So, who is he? We have to know him.
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
How?
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I
Go on a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Well, now--
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
Morse code?
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
Who else knows about this?
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Show me again...
You've already robbed the safe?
Oui.
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
Mr. Van Orton... ?
Ilsa... you're alright?
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
Do I have to play with the little kids?
Whatta you think?
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
You're going too?
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
Oh!
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
That's not the point.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
I'm not picking it up.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
Check it out!
It is today?
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.
Hello.  What is your name?
How was the flight, Champ?
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
This is your doing?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
And you broke into that room?
That's right.
You will wish you hadn't.
Yes? Ms. Woods?
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
Yeah, what happened?
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
You think so?
No.  I want to be with you.
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
I'm going home.
What's wrong?
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
Sigmund Freud?
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Are you happy?
EXCUSE ME
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
Why are you doing this to me?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
What are you doing here?
We have to talk.
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
Yeah?
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
Where am I?
My place.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
You've not been to school all week, son.
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
You sent for me, sir?
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Splendid! Is he sick?
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.
What's that book you've got there?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Keep going.
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
I'd fuck Elvis.
Really?
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
All I have to do is call the guards.
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Why?
Hey, munchkin.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
What?
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Look, I didn't shoot him!
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
Didn't they tell you?
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
Pop!
That's because he doesn't have one.
Whata you mean?  He told me -
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
Vernon Waldrip.
He said he worked there --
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
What business?
Increases?
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Well...no, of course not--
I want a child.
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
He's running the show.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Yeah.
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
You want me to just hang-- ?
Just hang a minute.
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
But why?
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
It is Victor.
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
Hello, Jefferson.
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Fine--
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Certainly would, Joseph.
How's Amos, Ma?
Just fine.
I  Mr. Lipnik 
Well?
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Good.
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
But I understand what you mean.
Great!  What is it?
It's a...full length life-size figure!
What's it called?
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Seriously.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Really?
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
You need a nickname.
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
My head hurts.
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Doggy.
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Montana.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Pillow.
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
All paved with diamonds and gold?
You know me better than that.
Paved with what, then?
How was it? I don't recall.
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
What's up?
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Yes, thanks.
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
Ah ...
What?
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
Layton! Oh shit!
What is it?
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Am I?
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
How do you mean?
How much do you know?
Not much.
Enough though, eh?
How's David?
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Helena --
We can't grab it...
You're the key witness?
That's right.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
What about you?
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Thanks.
I'm going to fill it right now.
No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
Life is just a state of mind.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
Your father was a sick weirdo.
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
This??
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
So I've noticed.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
What are you doing here?
Screaming
Besides that.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Frederico!
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Seems like it's going well.
I think so.
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
Jobs doing what?
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Danger?
. Yeah!
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
It feels so.. .real.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
This is supposed to be years away.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
How do you kill it?
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?
Why is it taking so long?
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Yes, I have mine.
Do you still want me to stay?
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
Get out --
Do you really not believe in God?
How'd you get the picture?
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
What about a radio?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
What the hell would you call this?
Well  the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
I got my wish anyway.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
But it's already come true.
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
Do you want us to come with you?
Jimmy, you've got --
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
You didn't?
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
I'm already dead.
I see your point. What's the favor?
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
Dream on, blue eye.
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
I've heard you call him Freddy.
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
It was going to be a surprise!
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
You better?
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. 
Here...
...they come!
And Brynner's right on...
...our ass!
Jill's coming with us.
Great.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
What do I got for you?
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
Coming.
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
Yes, I know.
I dove 315 feet!
Great!
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
Damn its hot in here...
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
What do you want?
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Hello, Hildy!
Feels good.
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
Hey, how you get out of here.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Then this is it.
What?
War.
Her oil pan is shot.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
That woman's gonna call the cops.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
Where were you?
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Who is "they?"
Did they send you...Did they send you?
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
He has a wife?!
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
God, that's awful!
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
I can't see.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
Gabriela! -- you did get away.
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
The wind --
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
What?
The doctor said you were having sex.
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Oh my god! On TV!
Why? How...
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
But Al is your husband now!
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
"Frenzy".
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
No.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
I didn't mean -
Who dies first?
Now look what you've done to him.
Have you got one or haven't you?
You test each one thoroughly?
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
Safety?
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
You know what I just watched?
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Return of the Jedi.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Empire.
Blasphemy.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
It was bad.
Bad?
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
Yeah, I know.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
I do, too!
All right, what do you know?
Why so coy about the word "frozen"?
Because, don't get into it ...
There's nothing in the files?
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
We got to get movin'.
What for?
Because there's a man I want to see.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
..I'm fine..and you?
Darling!
Operator...
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
What?
Sleep. Sleep now.
I should be better by now.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
But it ends up the same.
Those are my clothes.
What's on your mind?
I have a question for you.
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
Why do people go to war?
I'll play your silly game.
Why do they go to War?
To preserve their Way of Life.
Would you go to War to do that? 
I have.
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
My butt's bothering me!
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
It's amazing.
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Can I ask you a question?
Depends on the question.
Are you still in love with Alan?
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Why'd you let me in?
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
Good point.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
What about his parents?
He never sees them and I never met them.
Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
Now that's cool.
Cool?
Yeah, cool.
You think it's cool?
It's cool!
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
Why?
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
You couldn't have made that jump.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
He could have died.
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Y-yes--
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Swear.
What?
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
God of passages and changes?
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
I've read of it.
But have never been?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Yeah?
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
That's a good one.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
For what?
What's going on?!
Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
Police?
Huh?
You called the police?
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
Yes, quite.
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
What do you got on Korda?
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
Being faxed over now.
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Roper...
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
Hope you get to where you're going.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Oh, no!
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
Huh?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
So what's the time?
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
--Howard Hunt?
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
Any idea what he did?
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
--Teddy Kennedy?
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Again, I thank you.
What is it?
And some people need their medication tweaked.
Then what?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
What call?
He's stopped.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Where?
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Yes am.
Pretty close?
Pretty close.
Did he tell you about my party?
Sure did.
About my daughter?
No I didn't know you had one.
He didn't mention?
No.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
He didn't mention her.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
That depends.
On what?
The priest.
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
You wouldn't.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I beg your pardon?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
I didn't get you?
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Oh yeah, since when?
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Coffee?
No. I'm okay.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
When does it break?
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
You're kidding.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Three years.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
Mother... is Rose going to die?
Do you know what this is?
I presume it's a sword.
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Your murder weapon?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
A mystery.
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
Like what?
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
Man, that one made me puke!
You forgot something...
Are we leaving?
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
Yeah.
Why?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Right.
Aren't you?
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
What?
Sandro ...What's the matter?
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
What's going on ?
All ready?
...You know! For kids!
...Why don't I just type this up...
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
This scam we got going here was your 
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
It's a beautiful thing.
-- Merely in the interests of order.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
What?
I don't wanna lift crates.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
Nicole!
Vayanse. You others, go on.
Sir--
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Sir, you can't just--
I *know* this was right.
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Well...
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
I don't have another cat!
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
Why? You can't even lift one.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
What do you see...?
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
How's Linda?
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
I like it, Nick.
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
How much?
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Of course not. Please.
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
Five hundred.
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
How's it going? It's been a while...
...Six months.
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What kind of things?
You know, us.
I thought you met someone else.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
Really?
I miss you, Mike.
Why didn't you call?
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
...the Michelin commercial...
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
Hey, Bo.
Hiya, Jesus.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Are we under arrest?
Excellent.
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
Your entire body?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
What do you want me to say?
Just be natural, goddamit.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Why?  You interested?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
What's this?
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
You goin', Mom?
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
You sure you passed on my message?
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
You certainly do.
Do you trust me?
Implicitly.
Where did you go before?
When?
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
Oh, my God!
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
Been waiting long?
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
No cars.  Feet are faster.
How many more do we have after this?
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
I think they'll come out now.
They still seem nervous.
What's the matter with you?
What right do you have to take me for granted?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
What about you?
I'll look around and catch up later.
I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
And you believed that story.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
I've always taken care of you.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
It's the way Pop wanted it.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
Where did you find this clown?
I thought he was with you.
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
I know.  Every time!
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Can we get through these?
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
You lost your head.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
Michael, what are you doing?
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
They outnumber us, my Lord --
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Could this be that boy?
Brother. I cannot move.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Why?
Because you are dangerous.
Why?
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
I do not understand.
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
No.  Absolutely not.
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
What's your plan of attack?
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
What else you got?
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
What is it?
Like this. 
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
Then whose is it?
You gotta just look the other way.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'm not going!
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
You made this, and the drawings?
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
But it's July.
It's still the new year...
What about your job?
I have vacation time coming to me.
You don't have a passport.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
Yes?
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
Lamar --
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.
You'll never make it.
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Me! Jim--how--?
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
Y-yes, Jim.
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
Pretty well.
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Yes.
What are these?
Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
Why?
When they get mad, it gets cold.
You could hear them?
Frank, don't you have something to say?
You're doing just fine.
Where're you goin'?
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
Hello.
Well, Mister President.
What kind of trouble?
Are you saying that he's...
Smell the air. Wonderful.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Father's so proud.
And you?
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
I'll have to do better than that.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
You glad?
Is he good?
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Let Myrna finish.
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
And maybe a little something else?
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
I am.
Talk to us about it...
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
The money!
Any luck...?
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
I just said--
Pay money?
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
I never paid for it in my life.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
Thank you...
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Sir...?
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
Professor, I think you should see this.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
How's the arm?
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
He's moved on to TV.
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
What's her problem?
She has no real grip on reality.
Does anybody?
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
They know, don't they?
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Typical male.
Typical male.
Typical male.
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
How much did you pay?
Hello!  Good morning.
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Which stall?
Excuse me?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
I don't want to go back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
I don't care to bargain.
That insults them.
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
Hi.
...Hi.
We going somewhere?
Possibly.
Maybe I should drive this time.
What's wrong with it?
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
Suit yourself.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
German.
I can't...
Please say it.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
I'm not gonna kill it.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
If you came back.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
Something like that.
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
You the Captain?
Yes.
How do we get out of here?
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
How's it going upstairs?
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
What if we need a back up?
Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
Don't be ridiculous.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
I want to go with you!
There'll be a time.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
Did you see him?
Who?
The guy. He just came this way.
What guy?
There's somebody else on this boat.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
You sure it wasn't me?
Alvy.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
This is my room.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
No.
You're sure?
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
White House boys want a private meeting.
Give it more morphine!
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
You crazy?
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
I got to fetch her home...
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now.
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
What is it Rita?
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
<i>I forgot.</i>
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
You see that? You wanna be like that?
No. No...
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
What do we do?
But you said you have the worst reputation.
I do.
Don't you want to change that?
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Same time next week?
No. This is going to be our last session.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
Okay?
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Good news. You're going back to school.
When?
Its give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
A criminal?
You work here?
Yes, I do.
What do you do?
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
You'll be getting me sad next.
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
I still contain fragments of my human half.
And whatever you sensed out here....
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
You might still have a house.
I wish it could all have been different.
Now what can I do for you?
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk?  About what?
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
What's with the dip?
Will you step into the library?
And that's it?
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
It'd make their heads explode.
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Behold!
Be quiet.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
They're coughing.
They're gonna die in there!
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
I was hoping we could have a special evening.
I won't be late.
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there.
And where will you sleep beautifully?
Any luck?
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
What about money?
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
That's swell!
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
What will you do now?
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
He called you "MacLeod".
Not your concern.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
That bothers you?
He was innocent.
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
What about me?
You?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
Have you gone to the police?
No.
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
I'd rather hear yours.
You are being foolish.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
You saw what?
Well, thank you...?
Nikki.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
That's fair.
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
...gotta read my reports.
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
The fuck is wrong with you?
So what's the problem?
There is no problem.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
I wasn't hungry.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
I know your parents.
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out.
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father --
You, Blum go Motel.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Get car.  Get car.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
You know this earth - this person.
There.
Where are you going?
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
Me too.  For the most part.
Made your million, yet?
Not yet.
Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
No.
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
Thank you...
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
What?
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
And the grass?
I'm coming with you.
Yes . . .
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
Who is Don?
Don? Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Yes.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
No. I should go.
God, Kat! Please. Dont be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
He is.
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
What?
How could you not *care* about the movie?
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Me?
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
This ain't gonna work.
Rae...
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
Rae don't do this now...
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
I do love you... very, very much.
Show me.
I won't have you fighting over me.
I'll bet!
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
You get any sleep at all?
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
I'm sorry?
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
The name is Smythe.
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
I just got here myself, Susan.
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
You don't have toWhy, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
I came from the city on the left.
No, I guess not.
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
Hello Wade.
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Gold could be arranged.
For Munro children?
Yes.
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
Misha! Misha!
What is it?
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon.
Hi, Buffy.
What the hell?
This is cheery.
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
You don't believe that do you?
Ready?
Do you often model for Glaucus?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Me! No. Of course not.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
No. 
Why not?
Because they're still here.
Oh.
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
What is that?
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
Goddamn you, Cypher!
No, Mother, he's lying...
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
Don't talk to me like that.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
Be my guest.
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
Sorry.
No, it's all right.
What are you doing?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
They would have killed this man?
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
How long will that take?
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
Are you afraid of anything?
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.
Why did you wait?
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
It will not end tonight.
- - like birds - -

I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
What?
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
So let the council swear publicly.
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
How many?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
Okay.  How many going out?
I hear six.
When?
Looks like tonight.
You know who they are?
The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's  been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.
No.  You're right.
Show Must Go On.
A proud tradition.
Tell him to pull back!
Mr. Nevins?
Who's this?
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Mississippi?
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
Peter found him?
Right.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
And make sure he doesn't leave.
What?
Make sure he doesn't leave.
The Prince ... ?
Yes ...  make sure ...
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Like you, I found him not at home!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
I'm leaving Vanessa.
What?
You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
Who? Who is?
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
I know! I fuckin' know!
You don't!
I do!!!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
She does not!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
In Cluett's office?
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
Who told you I was married?
Have I died?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
You want to see me, Senator?
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
No?
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
That's right.
Oh, now--that won't do--
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
You're the best nurse I can think of--
Nice *compliment*!
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
No?
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
Yeah?  And what else?
What do you mean?
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
Are you all right...?
I...
Anyway... if you need me...
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
A card?
Yes, sir.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
Absolutely not.
Toss you for it.
What about this one?
You look beautiful.
Really?
Kiss the back of my knees.
Through the sweats or not?
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
They belong to the people.
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
You can always come see it in London.
Only if you were in it. Are you?
I wouldn't miss it.
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Are you an actor?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Are you really serious? About acting?
Why... yes.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Why?
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
You sound as if you hate it.
Gus, this --
No candy for me?
I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
That's not our intent --
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
What the hell you talking about?
<u>Do</u> it...
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
So - why the airport?
You don't?
No. 
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
C'mon -- what?
You're lying --
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
But --
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
That's when you went in the sphere.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
You manifested that, Beth.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
You're insane.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
I never went in that sphere.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
Yes.
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
That's bullshit.
Is it?
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
Shut up, Beth --
How ya doing, honey?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
I'm not hungry.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
Well--it was dark out ...
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
It was accessible to everyone.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
Kindred spirits.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
You punched the President in the face?
I'll have the same.
Of course.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
'A Moray eel....'
'Snuck up on me....'
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
... an offlander?
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
I got you a present.
But I didn't get you one...
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Yes -- let's run!
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
Good to see you, Diego.
What are you doing?
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
But they don't have a case against you.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Don't make no difference no more.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
You run the plates?
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
No.  Not even you.
Why so glum?
I don't know.
Go ahead.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
I don't believe it.
I'm afraid it's true.
I want to see.
No you don't.
Yes!
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
Your parents'd kill you.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Yah?
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Who am I?
How do you like that? Right on time.
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
Hello.
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
They go. John. They go.
What's wrong?
They go.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
She had you tempting fate.
What gives, Don Corleone?
We reinvented ourselves.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
So...
Yeah.
Where was that?
Walker and Williams.
What did you say your name is?
"It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?
What?
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
That woulda been cool.
I hope you're happy!
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, this has everything to do with you.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Well, look at this.
Be careful.
Is she...?
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Coming along, Jabez?
What are you going to do?
Just what I said I'd do.
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
How's that?
Have you made up your mind?
About what?
What? Deep down inside?
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
I don't think so...
Why not?
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
There's always exceptions.
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Can't that female take no for an answer?
I think that we should spend some time apart.
What's wrong?
Well, I need to study, and...
You need to study?
Yeah.
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
We'll see.
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
Come where?
My office.
For how long?
Well, that depends...
And the point is?
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
What?!?!
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
Trick him.
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
You should think about getting professional help.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
I feel like we're making real progress here.
What's with her?
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
Alright, so I'll get more.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
The Castle Anthrax?
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
But you had!
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
I think so too.
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
Yes!
No visa.
I must get into that country of yours!
Oh no. No visa.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
You're going to force us... huh?
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Why should I take a chance?
On what?
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
What for... why?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
I know, Dad.
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
Mother--
You make any sandwiches?
I can give myself a headache instantly.
Is that like a party trick?
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
It's been a long time.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
Wash them again.
We're not running a dating service here.
Mmm.
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
Yes.  I hear you.
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
Mmm.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Yea, how much?
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Let's just leave.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Let's go.
Mute!
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
Have you seen my wallet?
Roberto?  How long?
Yes.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
They're not gone, they're here.
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
The hospital? 
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
Not too hard, is it?
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Vincent <u>Farrell</u>, Assistant U.S. Attorney.  A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...
Let's not get excited, sir.
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
I was just tryin' to...to...
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
What?
What about when she goes out?
What's under that sheet...?
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
What you sayin' boy?
I think I recognize you.
How?
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
Probably.
I don't trust her.
Hello?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
Adelle?
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
Just get out of your vehicle...
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
It's quite satifactory.
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
You sure about this?
I'd stake my reputation.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
Bullshit...
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
They went that way.
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
Oh, hey...
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
I don't know what to...
The map said to go left.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
I can't move any smaller.
You read Russian?
It's marble.
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
Loretta...
Johnny...
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Good.
Have you come to make peace with me?
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
But he sure can kiss.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
Don't play games with me, little girl.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Well then who did?!
Maybe it was Colleen...
I smell it.  It's here.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
Why?
I hurt my finger.
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Rowan Mayfair.
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
You really love this guy...?
He's got great hands.
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
Are mom and dad here?
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
During the road test...
Yeah?
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Huh huh.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
An accident, Nathan.
Did you miss him completely?
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
Son of a bitch!
At least I let you tag along.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
No?
No. You like the way I do things.
Mom, you know that never works.
Ho, diplomatist!
See?
What am I looking at?
I didn't do that.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Dressed?
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
When?
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
Oh.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
Tonight?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Do you?
My very words.
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
Right.
Thing we can lift it?
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
I'm not mushing it.
You're mushing it a little around the--
Your line, George!
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Hey, I just...
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
I need Il Duce.
The Duke?  What did you do?
It's been 84 years...
Just tell us what you can --
Now many?
Is there any syrup?
Are you alright?
You want to share it?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Not at all. Morning Tom.
Not impressed, are you?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
With, like, images?
Do you trust him?
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
I don't want to go there.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Yes or no will do.
Oh. Well, yes.
How many languages do you speak?
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Bullshit.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
I don't know, but somebody did.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Until the old man tells me different.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Please, Uncle Al.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
They never find that girl.
Dr. Gruber...
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
I think you have more.
Well we don't.
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
What you got in there, warshing?
Yeah.
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
About a half a mile I think it is.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
Here.
What are they...?
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
They suspended me for 100 years.
100 years! 
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
What do you think I can do?
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
I believe you're right, boss.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
Sir?
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Don't they believe in signs here?
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
What's the point of this?
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
Poor darling, and then?
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
What is it? A sapphire?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Want a ride?
I'm all right.
Glaser Safety Slugs?
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
Kevlar Second Chance.
I hope you have a second chance...
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
You got it.
What is it?!
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
So I did! And what was so important about it?
National television?
ABC.
How much?
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
Will you lead me to her?
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
Hello?
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
I get it. You can drop it now.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Ha! Where's that?
Wait. I know you.
Yes?
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Excuse me?
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
A woman eh? I see.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
This is your dream girl, is it?
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
Well don't you think that's odd?
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
Keep your mind off her.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
And some man will lose his.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
He and his wife splitting up?
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Isn't he a salesman?
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
I'm leaving.
What are they doing now?
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
I ain't sure.
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
...Sure.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
David.
I'm coming with you.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
Grand Marnier.
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
Adele?  You in there?
Do you have to die to see God?
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
I was about to throw in the towel.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
1922. Why the kippers?
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
Whereas you are.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
And just what is the game?
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
Much better.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
I didn't. Mother did.
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
I'd love that.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Feel free.
I could go for a Coke.
Who are you?
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
You.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
please, what is it, please --
Who are you calling?
Mrs. Christian.
What?
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
Sure. You boys want anything?
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
You really don't remember?
No... I told you.
It was weird...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
I don't want to talk about it...
Sheila?!
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
I'm sorry.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
How's the spying tonight, guys?
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
It's not your fault, Daniel.
What they call you?
Red, and I ain't no punk.
I don't want to go.
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
That wasn't my fault.
What is it? What's in there?
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Let's hear it.
Robbed.  He was angry.
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
How'd you happen to miss?
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
I think we're moving.
I've been dreaming about you.
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
Good evening.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Oh, that's so interesting!
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
If you only mean to dupe me again --
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
That's awful.
Wasn't your fault.
He must be pretty good.
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
What about his brother?
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
Yes?
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
I get it. I get it.
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
I do.
What it smell like?
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
King of the WHO?
The Britons.
Who are the Britons?
How's Butkus this mornin'?
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
Where are you gonna go?
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
What are you getting at!
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
Take our literature...
Uh-huh.
...read it over, and think about it.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
playfully shoves his hand away.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
He never told me...
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
Well?
I used to work at the Diplomat.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Suppose that were the case?
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
I just want her to be happy.
You don't have any!!!
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
No, not yet.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Everything is quite all right.
Wait.
Why?
You can't take that.
Why not?
Something round, two wires ...
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
What's wrong?
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
What's the matter?
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Right.
Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
Jesus...
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
It's a test.
What'll I tell Fran?
Was it a party?
Something like that.
Oh, gosh.
4800 feet.  It's official.
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Are you getting tired?
I'm not interested in what you think.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
And tell Merrill to swing away.
About this much.
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
You were given backup....
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
No, I don't get you...
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
Yes.
I'm leaving, too.
But, Eve, I would--
What is it?
A tracer. You'll like it.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
I'm Joel.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound?
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
I'm not nuts.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
Mr. Bangs.
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
Yeah.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Yeah.
She's not with you?
You okay?
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
Who?  Who?  Who?
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Who, Ray?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
Serve.
I was trying to educate you.
Just serve.
In the same fashion as chess.
What?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
Will you shut up and play.
You're a bad loser.
I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
Uhura!... Where!
What was that?
It's getting late and...
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
That doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, this is better than rape.
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
There's nothing more to talk about.
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
Yes.
May I ask Why?
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
What're you doing here anyway?
Coffee and a donut.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
I knew.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
It's dark.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Or a big mother slug maybe?
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
That's right, Steve.
Can I have my gun back?
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
What time is it?
Are you referring to the background score?
Yes!!!
You've heard Beethoven before?
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
What's that?
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
Okay, that's IT!!!
Hi!
Hi there!  You alright?
We're fine!  How are you?
Help me!
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Can't you stay with us a little?
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Would you like another beer?
Nah... scotch.
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
What now, Sayer?
Missed.
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.
No, he's ruining yours.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
You have a real philosophy of life.
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
Not as long as I'm alive.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
What do you meanstarvation?
It takes money to buy food.
Why, haven't you?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
To New York?
Yeah.
I'm following you.
Aren't you afraid of me?
No.
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
You broke it? You know the source?
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Come on, Hoagie....
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Doesn't it worry you?
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
Good evening, gentlemen.
What's your story, Pete?
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
No -- keep it.
I'm hungry, John.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
I made a deal with Josh.
What?
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
What are you talking about?
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
I'm scared.  What is it?
I got 'em in the kitchen.  I'm eating her crumb cake.
I'll wait.
Hell of a night.
Hell of a show.  Hell of a job, Stan.
...one more day.
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
I didn't murder anybody
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
Tell me...
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
What an honor...
It's spectacular...
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
You're gonna love it.
Do you see?
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
You were attacked in the forest?
Yes. We lost five.
What are you doing?
Let's get you darker!
You're out of your mind!
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
They can use their imaginations.
How are you doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
I don't know what happened.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
To hear them read Torah.
I thought you hated Torah.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
Are you listening?
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
What did you say to her?
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
So I followed him...
You followed him?
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
You keep a bat under your seat?
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
Yes, great movie...
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
What's up?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
What happened?
Come on!
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
I'm saying, we're just friends.
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
Is Kay coming?
No.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Tom is right.
Thanks for the ride.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
None taken.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
The Academy, then CIIAC.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
How long have you been downtown?
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
I'm not--
I can't.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I can't.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
On screen...
A pet shop?
Go. They're off again.
Up.
What?  Up?
Yes...
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
Looks like a tie.
Who's gonna win?
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
What?
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
There's something else, Major...
Mmmnnn...?
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
I accept your generosity...
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Who?
This one. I think he's in here.
Uh-huh?
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
I can't! It's out of control!
Do you ever regret things you've done?
Everyone regrets something.
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Sometimes.
Do you think about their wives or their families?
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
Define small.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Proper?!
Fucking Mariners.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
What party?
The birthday party.
Huh?
What are you doing here?
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
What happened to him?
I wasn't doing anything.
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
It's not like her.
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Hello?
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
You're sure...
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Bitchin' good cake.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Sure. Why?
You're acting kind of...odd.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
Last year, this was a new rig.
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
I can see the benefit in that.
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
We should go.
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
For what purpose?
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
How did you hook up with Faith?
I like you very much, Walter.
What are you doing?
Yes.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Take it slowly.
So damn stupid.
You're done worse.
I'll be scarred for life.
It's twenty after one.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
How much?
Seventy a year.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
Sixty.
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
What was your deal with Job?
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
That's what you think?
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?
That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
Why? What I say bad?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Think about that reward, Johns.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
Why did you call me?
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
Goddamn it!
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
She say she in great pain.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
Today, a good girl.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
It's all right with me. Is he here?
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
Are you serious?
A beauty. Who is she?
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
What, Doctor?
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Everything?
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
...Are you insane?
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
Yes, Dad.
You understand?
I am ready now...
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
I'm already free...
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
They did?
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
Wow.  Why would they do that?
Cause of the chromium.
The what?
Vince knows you're here.
How?
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
What's your real name?
Martha Louise Livingston.
Are you married?
No.
Would you like to be?
Not at the moment, no.
Do you have any children?
No.
Would you like some?
I can't have them any more.
Why not?
I've stopped menstruating
Why do you smoke?
Does it bother you?
No questions.
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
One.
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
Are they going to work here too?
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
Got it.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
But I wasn't.
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
I can't say that.
Think about your father. Your sister.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
I'm fucking out of here.
Lawford?
I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
She always said that if you were on the outside...
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
Take care of me?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Want me to come back some other time?
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
It'll be okay.
The Monroe?
You going away?
Hey, buddy...
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
You <u>were</u>?
Hi.
Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
Thelma, that is not an option.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.

I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
You're a wimp.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Then your father's a wimp.
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
It's been known to happen.
Not to me, you know that.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
I told you! I told you I saw a --
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
Good God, you're really-
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
I don't think that bit's right.
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Keri, you all right?
We've got to get these kids out of here...
COME ON!
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
You're being paranoid.
You think you're so...but you're just...
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
To death?
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
The woman question?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
The walls are steel, right?
Not that one.
NOT THAT ONE?!
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
--there's thousands of 'em!
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
-- he's doing it then, huh --
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
-- okay, g'head --
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
Is it a charge, sir?
Yes  charge.
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Aw, get going!
Not it at all, really.
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
Here's yours.
There's been a slight problem.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
And what would you do?
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
Go ahead, Jam.
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Grace, I need you to come with me.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
No!
God, it's so clean out here.
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
All hands. Battle stations!
Having romance problems, Romeo?
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
Who is it?
Don't he have a home to go to?
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
There are no stupid questions.
If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
Catherine...
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
How are we going to get them all up there?
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
In about fifteen minutes.
Are you going to keep him, sir?
Now, he's really pissed.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
There was.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I know.
I was being foolish?
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
You're so sure of that?
Aren't you? After today?
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
That's your way, not mine.
That's God's way!
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.

So what do you do?
I'm a dentist
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
We have a gift?
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
Yeah. Cool.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Very cool. Trippy.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
But you will always be here?
Me?
You will always!
No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him.
Who is he?
You really want to know?
Yes.  Tell me.
You like spaghetti?
You know I love spaghetti.
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Yes.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
Were both thinking the same thing, right?
You okay?
But it's Christmas now.
Breakfast.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
Surely you've seen a man naked.
I don't feel like it right now.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
Sorry about last night.
Forget it.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
No.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
Fear and ignorance.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
Everything okay, David?
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
. . .For his own good.
I can't even hear myself think.
All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
She adores you.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
You know what happened.
No, I don't.
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
And what do they know?
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
That's right.
That's not enough.  Tell me.
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
Gertrude!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Had a feeling it was you.
You look alike.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Not her brand.



You've got everything?
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
I wish you were coming with me.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
Don't you want me now LESLIE
No way! You're kiddin'!
When did it come across?
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Where's it coming from?
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Is it coming from our own computer?
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
You want some berries?
Where's the manager?
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
Stand right here.
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
He's here.
Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
Well then who can?
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
What are you saying?
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
Law enforcement?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
Damn.
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
What?
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
...who among us is in a position to say...
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
She's gettin' away!
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
Dad, please...
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
Oh, I do too, sir.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
That's three.
What?
What'd I say?
That you were fired.
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Because of today?  The beach?
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
I know you did....
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Then, close the case.
I better keep looking.
Where, how?
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myselfI get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jeffersonand Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
Mozart -
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
Don't move. We --
-- should go back. Now!
No. Don't --
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Lose 'em.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
What was that?
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
Are you nervous?
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
What about Jeremiah?
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
What was it?
Nothing.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
"Francis Macomber."
Wha?
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
Are you okay?
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
Why not?
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Shut up.
Where you gonna be?
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
What's the green stuff poking out?
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Naw, I already ate.
So what are you going to do?
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
Anything you want, Boss.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Who do you want?
Thanks for picking me up.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
And what are you doing?
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
A nap?
Do you guys feel like painting?
What color?
Red.
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
Oh God, we can't get out!
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Finally got her back to sleep.
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
She's off her fucking rocker--
--I know!
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
--a <u>lot</u>.
Heather.
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Shoot.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
I'm promised to another!
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
Cash. I'm impressed.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
Never heard of him.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
Yes.
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Yes.
Why does he need money?
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
How much?
Well, that was neighborly.
Did she get my Double Burger?
Who is it?
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
Mama...
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
How do you know this...?
I didn't know you were out.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
But don't be too lenient.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
A murderer?
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
What's funny?
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
Cute puppy.
You're not seriously considering sending him?
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
Does he know that?
What's on your mind?
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
Hello.
Linnea?
Yes. Who's this?
I'm here.
Who is this?
Tom. You remember?
I'm not sure. Where?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Yes.
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Long's you git me back for the beans...
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
I never thought I'd...
I know.
I missed...
Get off his case sweetie.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Fuck you.
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
Not gonna let me in?
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Where're you going?
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
It's so late.
What? I'm not made of stone.
How about it, Ma?
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
It's true.
Imonna find out one way or the other.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
Buddy Deeds--
Get in 
It's a short life and a gay one...
What's happening?
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
You got the wrong window again, man.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
You fucking bastard.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
You raised me, like a son.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
You killed my parents.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
When did you first find out he was alive?
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
And Laszlo?
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
What's this guy's problem?
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
What're you talkin' about?
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
Well that's good to know.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
I would have stayed there if I could.
Lawyers?
...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
Get us out of here...
Nicholas...
Looks like the curse is still at work.
Yep.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
We have to get going.
I am not flexible on this.
Can you show us the way?
To Castle Couer de Noir?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Then you would have gotten your money?
Yes.
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
How long will you give me?
My Westley will always come for me.
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. Its been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
...How'd you sleep?
I don't know. Had dreams.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
Get your clothes on.
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
Get your clothes on, lady --
GET OUT!
God, you're beautiful.
What for?
What are you hiding?
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Wow!
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
Yeah.  I got it.
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
Anyone particular in mind?
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
So?
You know what I'm saying.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
I remember.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Guilt?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
You done?
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
It isn't any better.
Where's June today?
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Where you goin'?
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
I'm going out later.
No car.
The fuck not?
You know the fuck not.
Fuck.
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
Why?
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
I won't.
Goodnight.
You can get killed!
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
No!
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
It wasn't that bad.
Did he -- you know?
What?
You know.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
He made me lick it.
God, you're sick.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Cut it out.
When are you going to visit him?
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
What?!
I got tired of hating my father.
It was good.
How long did you travel?
I'm being a pain, huh?
... Not at all.
You sure?
Absolutely positive.
I don't want to go to Europe.
Where'd you get this?
Oh, you-you have that one?
Yeah.
Evelyn, right?
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Something like that.
Need a nurse?
Does that help?
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
What happened when you were twelve?
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
Of course.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
Does she wear glasses?
No.
This is totally unnecessary --
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
He's not Army, it's not official --
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
--Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
The medics are looking all over for you.
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
More of a game really.
What kind of a game?
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
I gotta get back to Cushman.
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
Hi, Shari.
Who's Shari?
Damon Bradley...
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
So we go to the bar.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
We'll take care of it.
Morning.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
How are you today?
Fine thank you.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
It ain't your locker no more.
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Nice, baby.
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Baby, you did fine.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
...Baby...
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
Why does that bother you?
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
I don't know.  My friends...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
I fear he may have to.
But can't you give me any idea?
Who.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
Do we know anything about him?
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Then, why'd he lead us here.
How did you get that bracelet?
You like it?
I always did.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
Thirty-four.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
All right, what's your husband's first name?
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
Joe, the writer?
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
Let's go talk first, Adam.
I think we get the gist.
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
Little rum in yours, too?
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
Police are coming.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
Why?
Good to see you, son.
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
No... no training.
Psych major?
English Lit.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
They've all stopped at the same time.
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
Buddy...
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
Put it back in park, Blade.
Thought you were dead.
I'm my own man.
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
Please.
Thank you.
The pepper, too?
No, thank you.
Depends on where you want to go....
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Nick, have I been a good partner?
It's a bucket of vomit.
Is there any blood in it?
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
He doesn't look very threatening.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
Let the party begin.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
Do you?
Yes.
Awaiting my orders.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
No.
You're that guy, the private eye.
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Only on a first name basis.
That's cute.  You're funny.
That's funny, you're cute.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
What's wrong with it?
Hi, son.
Are you all right?
You think so?
I don't see why not.
But what if---it wasn't real?
Throw it.
I guess you knew that, anyway.
I suspected as much.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
What do you mean?
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
When was this?
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Different?
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
A trifle.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
And what had you done?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Then what was it?
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
Then why did she object to you?
Because she was afraid.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
I don't understand.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
She already has a daughter.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
I see.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
I did.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
And the second?
Sure you do -- you win either way.
You got something better?
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
She's watching the car again?
Yeah.
Thousands?
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
Negative.  Negative.
How can you be here...
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
Thank you.
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
Three cents.
So, how are you?
Have you slept with him yet?
I told you I slept with him.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I guess.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
If any!
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
I am your king!
Well, I didn't vote for you.
You don't vote for kings.
Well, how did you become king, then?
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
Jesus.
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
How does someone get meningitis?
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
Ellie.  Arroway.
Peter Valerian.
Sounds like a Russian general.
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Son.
Well, why should I?
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
I guess.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Yeah.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Whatever helps you cope.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
C-4?
Excellent.
Where are the women?
Now this is war.
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
You are cold.
You're damn right I am.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
Give me one minute.
What I said before --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Yeah.
Yeah. You?
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
You go?  Not watch fun?
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
Listen to you.
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
And what do you call this?
What is this, David?
Oh, cut my finger.
I've got something in my bag.
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
Where the hell were you?
I had you covered.  From back there.
A lie?
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Well, sir...
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
I... I think I can... clarify...
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
Mac's signature.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
What's the matter with him?
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
Then don't go out with me.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
What took you so long?
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
No. I never was.
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
...why is everything always about you...
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Naw, it's... I mean...
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...
Wheres my real dad?
I guess so.
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
Is this a bad time?
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
Okay.
Because it's true.
I was called and I came.  What's up?
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
You needn't use that language with me
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
I wanted it
There's a different between want and
Not for me.
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
How'd it go in there?
Fine. How'd it go out here?
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
I said I was sorry.
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
What?...
We shot a skunk.
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
What about her?
No way.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Nine thirty
Might be tight.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
What?  What did you say?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
It's for you. Frida.
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
What year is it?
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
You just ripped my card in two!
Yes.
How are you?
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Gimme the ball!
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
You have very nice ceilings.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Not particularly.
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
I love Lucy!
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
He sure is pixilated.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
I already did that.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
I took them out.
Why?
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
I'm not following you --
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
What do you want to change about this moment?
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
There's thousands of units like this one.
Shit!  He sent them all.
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
Yeah.
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
Now that's a really big house.
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
... this is... uh... too funny...
What is it, Norman?
Well, I guess it's about that time.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
Excuse me, fella.
...did they...
Would you excuse us, please...?
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
What?!  You aborted our child?!
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
You're not ready.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
Yes.
I'll never forgive you.
I know.
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
I've got a date.
Every week --
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
Hurry up!
Capitalistic methods...
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
Your share.
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
The day you got me out of jail?
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
I have a television.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
What makes you think so?
Why do you cry?
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
Pain causes it?
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
Yeah, we're all above that.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
OW!
I'm going to leave now.
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership.
Shocking abuse of authority.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
Such as?
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Attraction is a complication?
It can be.
It happened to you before?
Yes.
Who was she?
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
What happened to her?
She was taken.
Did you --
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
Was she the only one?
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
Is this becoming complicated?
So why would he want to see you.
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
Are you sure you'll be all right?
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
There's no one in the corridor but us.
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
Arrest him.
What is the...?
What are you doing?
Yeah?
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Sid I can see you!
Where are you Dewey?
Who are you?
I'm ... your son ...
How?
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
I love him.
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
How do you turn the fucker off?
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
The bomb, asshole!
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
You know what I want, babe?
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
Then I'll call you a cab.
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Who has?
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
Sometimes, sure.
All right...  Come along.
What?
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Got cash.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Check.
Mints?
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
Johnny!
Stop, will you?!
Let go!
Stop being nuts!
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
I do care about you!
Here's your keys, Harry.
You really liked it?
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
Okay.
Hey, you alright?
What?
What are you looking at?
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
When?
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
Him?
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
What?  Assessing fines?
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
You got to be kidding.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
How is this legal?
You first.
Why me?
That's it.
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
We're working on it.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
What did you call me?
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
It's wonderful.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
Huh?
I say, to most people it's a washout.
That depends on what they see.
Now, what do you see?
"There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him."
What?
They're hauling Misery into court.
That's nice.
Norman, you have to look at this!
Mmnph.
He's trying to sink us!
Does this offer include my partner?
Only if he can be trusted.
Out of self comes selflessness.
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
You know that can't happen.
Oh, why is that?
Why is that, Louis?
How can I know such a thing?
I'm in town for a short time.
Try?
That is my permiso.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
That's S.O.P..
Who are you?
Who am I?
Yeah...Who?
I don't recall.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
I don't recall.
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
I go with you --
That what you want?
That's what I want ...
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?
What the hell?
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
Where'd you get this?
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
Never?
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
What is it?
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
I don't know.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
One drop?
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Someone wants to play with me?
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
What the hell happened?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
Tell him I'm not here.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Come and get me, soldier --
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
Yes, well, they are.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Is that important?
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
Is this a trick?
Any news on my wife?
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
There was no one outside.
There WAS.
What did he look like?
The bogyman!
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
Right.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Promise?
I promise.
Look, I'm sorry.
Fuck off, Dave.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Let's start from the inside out.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
What do we do now, Everett?
What are you, a cop?
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
You're talking about complicity.
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Hi Mom.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
I thought I'd wait for you.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
He's full of shit.
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
Are you sorry she's dead?
Start?  This isn't a good time.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
Later on.
Then I'll come back, then.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
What does this mean?
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
He drinks.
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
Now that's one ugly dude.
Huh?  What?
You finished here?
What?  Yeah.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
Listen to me: They got some of them.
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
Attacked how?
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
You didn't believe her?
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
Why not?
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
And the police did nothing?
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
How could you?
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
The word is Mob.
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
Yeah.
What do you feed him?
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Does he bite?
Anything?
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
Could develop.
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
What did I do?
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
Well of course.
Is this Ming?
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
Uh huh, why?
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
Fifty minutes.
A fucking wheelchair?
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
You know something, Harry?
I guess.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
What's that?
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
Go ahead!
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
Who are you talking to?
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
But you did -- I just heard it.
Let's go to my place.
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
I can run out and get it.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
I can't be staying long anyway.
How long then?
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
You a blue-moon fool.
Then we'll do something else.
What else?
Trust me.
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
I had to go look for this coupon.
The one you bought at school.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
Yes.
And she wanted to talk.
Yes.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
What are you doing?
You look swell in that threealarm number --
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
It's Ellie's cat.
Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
For what?
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
A key party?
Well?...
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Having fun.
Is this fun?
Driving?
Driving, talking to me...
They're both a challenge.
You have a great profile.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
This one.
You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
What are you thinking about?
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
We're out of here.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
And they made the first move?
Will you get a hold on yourself.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
I know, I know who wrote it.
What?
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
You what?
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
That's nice.
So you're going to Michigan?
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Onions?
What?
You want onions?
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
I know.  Salt and pepper?
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
I understand.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
I know.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Why the gun?
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
Uh-huh.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Yeah.
<i>Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i>
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
How long are they going to hold him?
Right! Where is he?
Who, Father?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
I want to see you, Terry.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Now don't give me a hard time.
What do you want from me, Father.
Your gun.
Mind your own business, Father.
This is my business.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Give me that gun.
You go to hell.
What did you say?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
How does it work?
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
And who is this?
He was a...good lover?
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
Now, you make a toast.
To new worlds...
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
How're we doin', then?
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
What can we do' mate?
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
James? My James? What's happened?
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Kidnapped? By who?
His parents.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?

What?
I... I brought you something.
A cigarette?
If you are logical.
I don't want to.
... How long was I asleep?
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
How many to a cell?
Four in this block, sir.
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Son of a bitch!
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Who cares?
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
How much you think?
Yes -- I think it is.
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
You'll never regret this, Ray.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
Of course you can.
What?
You know, Elvis bowled.
No kiddin'.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Sure, Sid.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
- canker sore.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
That he was.
They're making him a hero now.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Can't argue that.
So what was he?
Speak.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
So.
Where is she?
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
It's late.
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
Who?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Is that what he tells you?
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
Yes...
I've been to a few -- yes.
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
No.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Yes.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
Who says?
Mocky-Lock.
Oh no... No you don't.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
What film?
Watch your language....
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
GOOD LUCK, CHET.  SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.  YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
How so?
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
Stop it!
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
No way Doug, I can't.
I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
What?
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
Red Ball?
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
Or relieve me of it later.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
She wants a divorce.
Don't talk like that.
It's over, finished and done with.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
No!
You wanted to see me sir?
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
These two holes are yours...
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
You don't want to hear about it?
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
Right...
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
Well, I guess I'd better...
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
That sounds nice.
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
Pardon me?
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
What's the profile?
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
How can you, how can you say that?
Because he's guilty.
No, no he's not.
I cant stay here.
Why not?
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
I assume you want something?
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
Do you think I did it?
She's one of the sick people?
I think I need a little air.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
Where are you going?
Don't get psychic with me.
Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
What, working security?
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
Are you comfortable?
Yes.  Are you shaking?
No.
You're shaking.
I don't think so.
You're cold.
I don't think I am.
Then why are you shaking?
I don't know.  I'm happy.
What's this?
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
The evil eye doesn't work on me.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
You're a drunk fool.
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
Come on, get with the facts.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Ready?
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
But you're a superhero.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
I'm only half human.
Are you alright?
This isn't the time --
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
What if I don't want it?
He's very... clean.
Clean?
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
And clean.
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Fifty pounds? What for?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
--- What was that?
How much did you say it was, Tom?
You know how much it is, Nick.
And that does include the amp?
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
But I'll never win that.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
Really?
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
Why?
Who're these guys?
Where is he?
See where I'm pointing?
Yes?
See them two big trees across there?
Yes?
And the white house?
That's where the Brenners live.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
The two kids?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
I see. How do I get down there?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Mmmm.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Mmmm.
It's a surprise, you see.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Where would I get a boat?
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Of course.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Thank you.
What name?
Daniels.
This is not what I requested.
No, sir.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
Right, Chief.
So...? Where the hell is it?
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
He doesn't have a temperature.
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
Did you tell Sterling?
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
One hundred and twenty-seven.
How much do you think you'll need?
Shaddup, Vito.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
This is Jason's fault!
What about Han?
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Well, I'd best be off.
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Airport Ho-Jo!
Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
I know what's bugging you, of course.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
You got the admissions letter.
Right here.
And you're sure about this?
I hear you moved into town.
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me?
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
Jesus...
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
Who is that guy?
Policy man in Queens.
Shall we give it a name?
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
What brings you here?
What a beautiful day.
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
What are you doing?
Which ones?  I bring them all.
Road's in!
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
Yeah...but no ties.
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
No...
He said he traveled for two months.
With pleasure.
Well, that's different.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Goin' dove huntin'?
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Hi.
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
We're not leaving Crutch!
What's the plan?
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
You're a redhead.
I know.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Why not?
Just don't... I've got a headache.
You did kill those men.
Not all of them.
When you finish, what then?
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
You make it all sound so simple.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
You want me to front for you.
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
I... remember.
What?
Hi dad.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
I'm fine dad.
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
What was she afraid of?
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
I'm through!
You want a drink?
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
But...
Well, I met someone...
Fast work. You just moved here.
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
He sure did.
What?
I gotta know... did it work>
What is that awful looking place?
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
He has Israel.
Those aren't Jews.
Of course they're Jews.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Are all Jews the same?
Hey, it's the General.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Come on in--
If it's too late--
Elaine, what happened to us?
How well do you know her?
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
Who with?
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Lose?--I won a little--
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
What do you know about them?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
You can live that down, can't you?
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Who? Tell me!
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Hey, you couldn't know.
I still feel like shit.
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
What's she doin' here?
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
Why should it?
That's right... Take one of these.
What is it?
Please, Ed.
But it's...
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
If I look weak now, it's over.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
Should I just take the documents now?
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
A bad heart.
What's so funny?
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
Is it safe?
Do we care?
I think we Nought to wait.
I say we go.
You say we go?
Do not inhale.
I'm not ready.
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
That must be the one!
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Yes.
I don't want to scare people.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
Help me move him.
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
Where?
In there.
It frightens me.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Then..then what's that music?
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
Something's making that music.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
God, you are square.
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Departmental policy.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
What are you doing?
What?
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
Satellite feed.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
Good title.
And yours?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
What is the story?
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Ethel.
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
The daughter of his enemy.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
-- gee...
-- what?
I don't know what gets into me.
You were great.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
No you didn't.
You don't think so? I do.
You were great.
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
He's got you worried, then?
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
We didn't get that far.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
By who?
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
You heard right.
You really are one dumb asshole.
Life is unpredictable.
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
I didn't see nothin'...
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
I know... I remember.
Well?...
I ain't heard of nothin'.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
How cold?
Wanna drink.
Please.
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
What?
Our own special bus.
How do you know it's for us?
Superman? Has something happened to him?
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
Can he save her?
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
Nothing.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
You'd probably tell me.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
Lee!  It's him!
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
You're not losing trust, are you?
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
How you figure?
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
How was your plane ride?
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
I'll send it to you at Glades.
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
They're okay.
You alone, or you got confederates?
I'm not alone.
How many you got in there?
I got Sal.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
Who are they?
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Does she know about us?
Jesus, she's my best friend.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Why baseball?
What's up, Doc?
Does "they" mean the White House?
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
When so ordered.
Close as I can get, el-tee!
What the hell -- ?
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
I'm getting her out of there!
Of what?
Of him I think.
Did she say that?
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
Taylor -- quit riding him.
Another sex dream?
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Come on out a minute, okay?
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Why do you want to know my name?
I'm just asking, what if?
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
I was attacked.
<u>What</u>!
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
Get a dance yet?
Nope.
Me neither.
Who'd you ask?
Tina Wilcox.
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
That's a crock of shit.
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
And what of these foreigners?
Love you, man.
It's coming along.
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
'Intimate? !"
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
My ticket?
I found it on the seat.
Don't touch him.
How many men have we seen die?
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
It is ended.
You're kidding --
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
Arthur wants to quit!
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
I must of been outta my mind.
When'd he tell you?
This morning.
Where was I?
You were asleep.
He told you and you let him do it.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
...this time.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
I'm not very good at this.
Neither am I.
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
Damn.
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
Death is like spring training?
Doctor, we've just about had it.
No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
Have you seen him?
Alex, I don't have the time --
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
Only me and Mom ..
How about any guys on your staff?
... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
But I must go here.
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
What is hitchhike?
Carrie, watch for Early.
What are you going to do?
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
How did it go?
I really look like shit.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Yes.
Vat about it?
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
Mm.
Good?
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was you, wasn't it?
It was me, what?
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
My God...
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
Is it your software?
You sure you're okay -- ?
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
How'd I know it was for you?
I said go around!
You said go between them!
Mph rmpmh rm.
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Yes, it's a miracle.
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
Squash it.
Nerves of steel.
No rust?
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
Meaning?
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Tell them to get something to eat.
I thought we were poor.
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
I can just feel my spirits soar.
Anybody live here?
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
What am I supposed to do?
The only one?
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
What did you say?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
He got off on six.
That was quick.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
Mr. President?
That's my r-r-rent.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
With their berets...
Oh my God...  Hello.
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
We can live with that.
What's so funny?
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
What way?
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
If you need anything, just...
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
I will.
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
I won't.
Get into bed.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
La what?
La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Should I?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
So you havent seen the film, then?
Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Oh... We split up.
Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
Yeah?
Give this to Joey, will you?
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Shut down accelerators.
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
No.
Why not?
Shall we start the, uh...
You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
What did you think?
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
God help us. God help us all.
Is that so?
What do you want me to do about it?
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
And this makes you "sad"?
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
My name's 
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
Huh?
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
Sing a song of sixpence.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Nothing.
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
Where we headed?
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Pretty impressive, huh?
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
From where -- Neptune?
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
You know this guy, don't you?
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
By stealing my car?
I would've come back for you.
Yeah.
It's just a dream.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
You ever wear one of these?
I don't ski.
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
Rogue?
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
Terry, no, no... .
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
See ya later.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
Yeah.
Then why are you looking for her?
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
They're going to rob that bank.
How do you know?
I wish we did. You married?
Um, no.
How can you still believe she's innocent?
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
And you know this for a fact?
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
So?
Hello, guys.
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
Whoo!
Whoo!
I made it!
 I made it.
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
You okay?
What the fuck was that?!
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
Gee, you think so?
Holy--!
 Okay.  That didn't work.
 Gee, you think so?
Shut up!

Ho, ho...
 Oh...
...ho!
 ...shit!

 
Hang on!
Hey!

And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because...
...this way.
Jamie, wait for me.
It turned itself back on, Nick.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
I get the picture.
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
No accents today.
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Jesus...Jesus!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Oh...
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
Dr. Pamela Isley.
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
I see you knew him.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
Get him out of here?
Yes.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
I will relay the message.
That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
You did not know?
Well...no, not really --
You and he are not doing things?
No!
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
What is that?
Our greenhouse.
Oh, I like that very much.
So how was it?
That... was... no... simulation.
I know. I'm sorry...
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
I can't discuss --
-- You can and you will.
You're finished.
... it connects you to me...
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
You can't use that until Neo is out!
This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
On channel 10?
Okay... now let me time you.
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Come on!
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
No-
Who are you? What is your name?
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
And--?
And I love poetry above all.
Did you feel anything?
CONTINUED
Make them eat the figurine.
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
I don't like sugar
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
This is a sexy case.
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
Doesn't fit.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
That information's being withheld from the media.
This is from the people of Burundi...
Oh... Thanks.
Just what the hell is he talking about?
Are you sure about this?
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
In the Folk Music Section.
You think he got my license plates?
How do you deal with --
WHAT?
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
Remember my promise.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.
But we saw Earth destroyed.
I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
What's the decoy?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
I don't know what you're talking about!
What's the Boom Boom Room?
I've missed you.
How so?
That's what he told you, huh?
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
Honey...
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
What've you got?
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
What did she say?
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
Now!
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
Yes.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Yes. What is it you want?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Waitin' in the lounge.
How 'bout Mallory?
Yes, sir.
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
You ready?
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
What are you doing?
What?
That's a ridiculous move.
Why?
Because, I'll take it.
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
We're never gonna make it.
Darling, Peter says I could stay
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
You're very... kind.
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
Options.
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
It's Marty on the Coast -
Love and happiness for ever.
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
You have a stunt bottom?
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
See ya, Bandit.
And then what?
Yes, David?
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
Look at this.
What?
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Milo --
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Thanks for everything, Pro.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
Will you still get the money from your father?
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
No?
Should we close down any eruption?
Are you sure?
We're seeing all the signs in town.
What is it?
We've met before, haven't we?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
At your house. Don't you remember?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
At your house.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Are they fighting?
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Awful lot of money.
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
No! I don't want to leave you!!
Mathilda, listen!
Yeah...?
Sonny...?
Yeah.
Where's Riccardo?
On the phone.
Okay, Ray...
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Sure...
It brings out my eyes...
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Waddaya think?
Lucky lady. Hi.
I'll go back to them.
You gotta hold this for me.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Just put it in your purse.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
No way, Jos.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Put it in your pants.
No.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
I think that went as well as could be expected.
She always looked out for me.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
We're never getting out of here.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
How goes the roll call?
Vader's on that ship.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Come on -- come on --
Please.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
No, really?
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
I know, I know, and your hamster.
Yes!
Dead Cat!
Dead Cat?
Yeah.
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
Okay.
Meaning he'll need a plane.
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  But...do you see?
Yes.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Yes...
But, but but but...
No, no, I see...
That: in an act of...
Yes...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
I understand...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
As the Old Mill goes around...
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
Of course.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
No!
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Whoo!
He is very observant.
Susan!
What's he going to pull--
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
We got off at the wrong stop.
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
Any sign of the hostages?
Mike!  The party starting!
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
What's that supposed to mean?
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
Thanks.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
Here's to you, sir.
Er, good luck, yes.
I'd better be going.
Er, my check, please.
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
On the night table.
Keep stallin'.
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
How do you know if you've never tried?
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
Did you like school, Creasy?
No.
Not at all?
No.
Aren't you being a little hard?
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
We're just closing, friend.
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
That's real big of you.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
...What kind of man *are* you?
...Huh?
What kind of man *are* you?
Big Dave--
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
I, uh...
Come, it'll help you sleep.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
No.
Look at that.
I see.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Ya know, I was.
Really?
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
It sure is.
Arlo.
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
Hey! I'm not ready.
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
Is it hard?
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Like big lizards.
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
Dorsia, yes?
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
Wait a minute....
Too late, it's written.
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
Earl, you must never do that again.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Dillinger?
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
That ring--
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
What's this guy's problem?
Could we talk about that a little later?
Of course.
Someone you know?
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
Hawkins?
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
What about the share.
You get fifteen percent.
I got partners.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
And the Jews?
So?
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
First paycheck?
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
What?
A G...g...g...
You mean a safecracker?
No bleeding.
What is that?
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Ours.
Oh, I see.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
But I don't have it.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
Did he put you up to this?
Who?
Graham.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
God, you... you're mean.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
You're out of your mind.
You disappeared.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
Are you...okay?
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
Lois, what are you doing?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Uh. . .
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
...what's he got against you?
Meet me at this address after school.
I have cheerleading squad.
Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
What the fuck was that about?
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
Bullshit.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Can I go get those mangos now?
Well --
Where is the money?
Don't tell him --
Shut up, Violet!
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
Nothing.
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
Why? What's wrong?
You are a valued customer, as you know.
But what's wrong?
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
What is?
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
But they must be! They cut glass!
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
Yes, yes he did.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
I'm holding your hand!
No, you're not.
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Sheldrake?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
It's possible. I don't know about that.
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
You have to come.
Which one?
The roller disco one.
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
He found you, didn't he?
Get on the bus.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Just get on the bus.
I'm not leaving without her.
John, you can't help her now.
What?  Where is she?
Thank you, my lady!
Lady?
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
Is it the frank or the beans?
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
Fine.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
I know.
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
Oh, boy! 
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
No! Do they show you having sex?
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
At what point?
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
You would?
Yes, I would!
Like that?
Like that!
I know all your tricks.
And you're going to fall for them.
So you think you can get me?
Any minute I want!
You're conceited--
But attractive--
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
No, no, I wanted to get away.
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
So?
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
Stop him, Clark!
He may have a gun!
May I help you?
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
Yes.
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
Thank you-
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
I never learned jazz.
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
I'm not catching a melody.
How did you come to Gateway?
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
I love this house.  I really love this house.
I feel bad for his family.
Yeah.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
It's not even noon --
It's not just a gag, huh?
Keymaster?
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
So it's an honor?
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
I haven't been a detective for four years.
You don't say --
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
I see.  I see.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
No word at all?
How could you do this?
The Colonel helped me work it out.
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
A few more days. We know who did this.
So do I.
Spooning the sherbet.
Can I take your picture?
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
Is that all?
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
Because it ain't natural, young man.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
I had him!
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
Yes.
My Doctor Lady?
The color of your hair...
Ah, no!
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
What did she want?
Who?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
What night?
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
What's suck night?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
Hungry, anyway.
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
It's the best fork of all
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Right away, Exposition.
What did he want you to do?
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
Magda!
Mason???
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
Why not?
It's a rebound.
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
But! I'm a married woman!
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
...a pocketful of rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
What's he doing here, Sid?
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
And Reynolds?
What happened?
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
Do I look as funny as you do?
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Well, why don't you say it?
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Eighteen.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Too young or too old?
What'd you say?
I said I got his machine.
No, what did you say on the machine?
I left him a message.
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
-- what guy?
-- this guy with Jill.
You did it for me.
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
He married you, didn't he?
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
What about that apartment?
They'll know who I am.
I found it...
And?
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
He must be replaced.
They look like plain old rocks.
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
Jake...
When did you get back?
A few days ago.
Hurry, hurry.
Do you always sleep with him?
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
It's quiet.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
That's me.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Nine.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. Jos knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
Meaning...?
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
We? I don't think so.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
How did you meet him?
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
Not unless we're blind.
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
Meaning what?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
We need guns.
We don't need guns.
I'm pretty sure we do.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
All the more reason.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
Wanna bet?
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
It was six in the fucking morning.
Float me a hundred bucks.
Why?
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
You're out of money?
No.
What do you have left?
Eighty.
Eighty bucks?!?
Eighty five.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
You did?
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
What about it?
My God... I saw this.
It frightens you.
Yes...
You lame Taylor?
What?
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
Not much time.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
Sean's still out there.
...is there?
This is three years old.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
Steven!
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
I'm literally going to kill you!
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Why don't you get to the point.
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
You better stop running from that girl.
Well, what do you think?
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
If you could, I'd 
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
A toupee that flies?
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
But why the hair?
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
Yes.
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
He's come to rescue me, father.
Where?  Here?
Here.
There?
Here.
Here.
Feel anything?
You all right?
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
It's not good...
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
I can' take you to a hospital.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Lie back down, and try to -
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
David... please...
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
Relax, I got him.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
About what?
I'm going for 'em!
No!
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
Jesus.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
What are you saying?
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
Four? There are five.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
No harm no foul.
No.  Thought he was with you.
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
But he didn't ask me.
My God!  He's so excessive!
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
And I know what I'm talking about.
You like a good saloon?
It's the only place I'm happy.
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
You starting that again?
He's still sitting in that damn field.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
Sir:
Shut up, Starling...
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
And do nothing. Just sit there.
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Only in bad weather.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
-- Alright, alright but --
Where are you, anyway?
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
You try and have a good time.
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
I'll call them, okay?
It doesn't matter...
I'm going to call.
Do it for YOU.
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
What's up?
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
Yes.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
What does arresting us get them?
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Like cancer with a purpose.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
I don't like your following me.
I didn't follow you.
Then how did you get here?
I always eat here.
This is a place for workmen.
...Yyes
Yyyess.
Yyess.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Yes!
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Yes.
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Hello...
My name is...
My... name is...
John Merrick.
John... Merrick
Say "Merrick".
Merrick...
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
I don't think that's funny.
It wasn't meant to be.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
You loved him?
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Your place or mine?
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
Whacking?
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
We do not go into your courts.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
Howdy.
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
What happened to her?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
No.
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
You done with your small talk?
Sure.
Are the disks still in your room?
Yes, Mr. President?
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
And it's proving quite effective...
Does it make the cars any better?
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Perceptual?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Why?
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Yes, but I wouldn't...
The tap. What you do for a living.
I'm a salesman.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Myra, I'm not following this.
How was she?
Fabulous.
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Who's "Patty."
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
Find out who they are?
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Interesting.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Where at?
Palmdale.
Then why do you still like her?
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Brunette.
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
To what?
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
What?
The "crises"?
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
Whatcha mean by that?
Yes, your name?
He, I'm Mona.
Hi, Mona.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Do it again.
In time.
No now.
Because I try to be nice to people?
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
He's betrayed the class.
Oh, leave off!!!
Temper! Temper!
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
Roger, maintain.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
Is that what you came here to say?
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --

Understand, I had help-
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
What's wrong?
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
It feels really... good... here.
More light, chief?
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
You can't sing at the competition.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
Dont do that...
Who knows?
Where do you want it?
Yeah, one of them's out.
Stop it!  Stop it!
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Yeah.
Gimme back my bottle.
I'll help you in.
It's just an assignment.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
Come and get him.
More romances for John?
Hmmm?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
That I am very little different from him.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
What's that?
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
Good, I hate long waits.
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
I didn't throw him, he fell.
What'd he do to you?
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
How can you kill him like that?
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Who was he?
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
Not yet.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
I don't want to hurt you.
The creator of what?
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
You move well.
Just trying to make it look real.
He's your boss. He's not your --
I know, I know.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
Isn't that -- extreme?
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
That's not quite what I said --
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
No, I don't think so?
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
Sorry, I don't remember.
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
I dunno.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
I dunno.
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
Is that your official response?
What's that you say?
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
What?
You'll always play with me?
Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
Who are you?
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
There's so much...
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
What?
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Great.
You're a big help.
Alright, the beige one.
I hate the beige one.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
Why did he shoot her?
He was watching a ball game on television.
What?
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
You mean,  this ring?
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
Hey.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
Why did you do that?
It's today?
I want that fucker dead.
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Are you saying she liked it?
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
You're talking to me?
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
It won't be a problem.
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
Okey-doke.
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
Well, what a lucky break for me.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
Where did you get it?
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
I've got no stomach for murder.
It's a combat action.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
Then step aside.
No.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
You flatter me, Caesar.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Caesar?
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
You can't.
Why?
Let me go.
Where?
To the church, I must go there.
Madeleine --
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
Do you... live around here?
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
I thought... you was an angel.
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Great.
Don't forget your CDs.
Those aren't mine.
Sure they are.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
I guess I am.
Ow! These chips suck.
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
That bad, huh?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
No!  You gave your word!
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Okay, friend. You're on.
Call it.
Can we talk?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Cheap date.
Least she had time for me.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
You forgot to be there.
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
Stay!
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
Least you got your priorities straight.
I never asked you to choose.
Never had to.
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
Hello Bud.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Objection!
Really?
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
Yes?
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
Stop it.
Hi.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
Excuse me.
In the new library there.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Depends how you define 'new'...
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Yeah. How'd you know?
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Four colors? Neato!
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
What's wrong?
I don't know where to begin...
What are you talking about?
You gonna climb that with one arm?
Where's it headed?
First contact...
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
What's the frequency?
OhMary
Yes, sir?
How is she?
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Oh, no, sir. No different than
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
This time. What about next time?
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Really?
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
Right.
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Oh!
Its working.
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
I'm cool.
I'll share something with you.
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
This looks pretty good on me.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
Mom?  You okay?
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
No wonder he let her go.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
I think I should.  3000W?
I don't know the steps.
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
But surely...
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Any clue as to what it is?
Oh no. What is it this time.
We used to take baths together.
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
Those two musicians from the garage!
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Now?
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
Why is it -- breaking up?
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
He's not here.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
He's my father, Millie.
Hello?
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Fuuuuuck
Can your man handle that?
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Can you set that up?
Stay still.
Where's my ELT?
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
You got one?
It was blown up with the plane.
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
No more about Beynon.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
I...uh...
They wrong?
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
So how long have you know Meurice?
That seems a shame. The night is young.
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
Spock...!
That's your story!
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
He's my teacher!
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
What's the problem here?
They're all the same.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
It's kind of overwhelming.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
What do you mean?
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
But they're all the same.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
Slow down, huh?
Chris, can you do me a favour?
What?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
Maybe they're not tricks.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Don't sneak up on me...
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
I'm yours.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
But why now?
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
I could not think of not accepting.
Jesus, Charlie, I...
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
She said yes.
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
All day again?
What about Carter?
Tight. But I'm working on him.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
Thanks, I like yours too.
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Yes.
Isn't that rather too close...?
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
No...
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
That little prick.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
That little prick.
I paid for it and everything.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
It's none of my business?
Yeah.
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
No, thank you.
This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it.  You believe in fairy tales?
Fairy tales?
Do you believe in them?
No.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
Woodsman?
The one with the ax?
I don't know.
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
Little Red Riding Hood.
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
What? Palace? Hardly.
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
You've got to be kidding.
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
Mr. Dawson, I --
Jack.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Well, here you are.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
You're welcome. Rose.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Is he your boyfriend?
I'm up.  Thanks.
How did you get hurt?
Kalen...
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
She's not his mama either.
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
Do you understand that?
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Good.
I was just kidding around.
Good.
But why shouldn't I?
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
No.
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
Hi.
How you doin'?
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
What the hell?  It shut us down.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Recent hours have been a shock.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
What is its antidote?
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
Honored to make your acquaintance.
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
Are you going to see James tonight?
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Maybe.
Oh god, Laura.
Well, why not?
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were 
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
Fredo.  Where are you going?
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Yes, sir.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
You need to say a bit more than that!
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
What if he did?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
But they would! Don't you see?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Why is it?
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
Would you like me to seduce you?
What?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
What'd he say?
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
I know.
Otis!!!!
Otis!!!!
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
Otis!
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
Love?
You walked out on a five year marriage.
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
It's not like this all the time.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
And how hard it hit?
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
That is not true.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
Well this didn't.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
One seventy-nine.
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
A half hour.
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
I should start.
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
With you? I don't think so.
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
What are you doing?
Thanks.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
...maybe...
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
You're a comedian?
Yeah.
What's that like?
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Are you sure? Maybe...
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
I'd say about two weeks.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
But what if they went -- nowhere?
Now just a minute...
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
Rub it on the windows!
What-
You should have put that on last night.
I know.
That way it sets.
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Marcia's living with a singer?
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
How do you feel?
Strange.
But a good strange.
Is it?
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
Call what off?
The fight.
What fight?
Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
What nurses?
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
I'm...
Done?
Yeah, thanks.
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
REALLY?
Really.
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
The Fortress moves?
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
You have not slept in two days.
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
Close your eyes.
Why?
I've got something for you.
A surprise?
We're going to New Jersey?
I hate that picture.
Where are they?
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
Where are they? Last chance.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
Good!  That's good!
You two....
What? What are you thinking?
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
Sounds grim.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
We'll be there.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
It's locked.
You have to do it.
I refuse.
Good reflexes.
Yeah.
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
No, I'm--
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".
How much?
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five bills.
Five.  On credit.
Hello!
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
I never said help us!
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
Doc. Nice to meet you.
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
Thanks a lot.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
Why not?
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
What?
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
-- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details.  -- To see such determination is reward enough for me.
Why do you want to speak to him?
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
Did you... kill him?
Did you get him?
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Well, don't get carried away.
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
Would you like something to drink?
What are you having?
Iced tea.
A raft.
A blimp.
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
I know it well, sir.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
Sir?
It's already started, Dad... with me.
I know.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
Here? In Berkeley?
Yes.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
But you're not enrolled.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
You okay?
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
<u>Liza</u>!
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
What...?
The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
They were gore before I came here.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Why's his britches round his knees?
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
I'm just saying.
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Yes.
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
Increase his heart rate.
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
It would be an added stress to his heart.
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Is it murdered man?
Everything okay?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
You didn't tell him about me?
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
No. Why would I be?
You're being really immature.
...have you come back?
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Lime, I need to use your computer
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
No beer?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
Barely.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
What type of planes do you have?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Two years!?
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Do you believe in hell?
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Where you goin'?
What are you doing with the Ivans?
I want to make a good film.
I know you do.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
The Genesis planet is gone.
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
How's that possible?
What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
I'm tired. I want to go home.
...We know so little about each other.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
A blue rose.
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
Why?
It was a test.
Almost there, Louis.
You keep saying that.
What's that?
What's so funny?
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
You don't seem all that proud.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
Heal who?
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
You're talking about the precogs...
How're you doing?
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Oui, doctor, oui.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
Oui.
You decide. Today is your day.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Oui. Perfect!
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
Uh-huh?
Take your second position.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
Roy?
About this.
What's that?
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
I can't leave my job, George.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
More than you need me.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
...and hypocrisy.
The Voice again.
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
It burns.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
Isn't this fun!
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
Forget it.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
Are you alright?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
They asked about you.
What did you tell them?
That I really don't know.
Now what?
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
I got you, Del...
...well, then you ain't got much.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
Egypt?
That's right.
But why Egypt?
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
You should take the Vulcan, too.
No.
But, why?
That's a secret.
You have a lot of secrets.
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
No.
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
No.
Why not?
Who's that?
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
The pain. The fucking pain!
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
You are being ripped open.
I know.
Did you bleed?
I didn't bleed.
You didn't?
No.  We can't.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
We don't know that.
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
Well someone's gonna find them.
What is the common thread between these victims?
I'm sure I don't know.
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
Yes, you should go.
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
You seem to know a lot about him.
Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
Did it do you any good?
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
Aw, he isn't that good...!
Be more specific.
A station wagon in Canada.
What's her greatest fear?
Her brother.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
What stinks so bad?
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
We can show her the schoolyard.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Ted.
Uh, huh...
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
"Get to know your therapist."
You were messed up, man.
But look at me now...
I'm back.
I'm at the airport.
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
You've broken its leg!
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Isn't there an easier way?
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
What is that?
Room service.  What do you drink?
Diet coke.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Can I have some chips?
He's somewhere...
What are you doing?
What's mine say?
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
It doesn't say that.
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
You like?  It's all yours.
Mine?
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
Listen.
What is it?
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
No, there isn't.
Chut up!
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
Rowan.
They've got Jean-Louis!
That sounds like their problem.
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
B-but I have them.
Alright... I might need your help.
My help?
A little bit... Give me your belt.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Huh!
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Why did you do that?
Where what?
What about the picture --
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Who made you do this?
Kill me!
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
She's a bird, Willow.
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Watch it!
Remember me?
What's outside of Pleasantville?
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
And you let her get away.
I tried to help you...!
And hey, I appreciate it...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Well, you want to or not?
What's going on?
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
The very same.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
I plan to grow on you.
You're off to a late start.
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Walter...I can't believe it.
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
You certainly have a nice place here.
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
Charlie -
Yes?
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
Why not?
No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
What?
Maybe I should call Janine.
Easy for you to say.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
Oh no, it can't come now.
I don't know.  Maybe.
You were supposed to be here at three.
I forgot.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
What do you think, Lou?
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
Do me.
I love you.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
Maybe they lied to you.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
How you doin'?
I'm all right.
You ever done time before?
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Unless the gun was slanted up.
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
You ought to be used to me by now.
I'm used to you...
What do these ingredients mean?
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
Kay... Kay...
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
He's not the same as when I met him.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
You drink at 10 am, do you?
No -- no -- I mean--
I wanna see the picture today
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
He personally asked you to?
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
Charlie Dalton.
Big Ringo fan.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
I would.
Did you do this?
Victoria -
Hmm?
Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
When do you think it'll be done?
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
What do we have to do?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Yeah... Sid?
You got clicks, anything?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
What other issue is there, Sid?
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
Go on, beat it!
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Do you want the truth, Anya?
It would be a nice change from you.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
How'd you ever get away with it?
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Sure!
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
Then let's go. Now!
I haven't finished my drink.
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
I can't let you do that either.
Because you're afraid!
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
I could force you.
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
You okay?
Yeah. You?
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Yeah.  Big time.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
What did you want?
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
That's one idea.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Oh.  Sorry.
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
Put your head back.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
You can do it.
Because I'd met someone else.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You believe that?
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
Must be in love to manage that.
Wally...
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
Good morning, Louise.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
... I see.
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Yes. I've seen that done.
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
Yield *how*, sir?
Will he yield for a question?
Ah, now, that's better.
Will he *yield*?
For a *question*.
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
It does!
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
Mr. President--
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
I have no defense against forged papers and--
An unexpected pleasure.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Who got himself what?
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
Uh huh.  Okay.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
What did you tell him?
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
What's this?
...Oh, Jesus.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
Mm.
Raincheck?
Ah... Northeast... sir.
That's all?
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
How'd you find me?
Winston found you.
How the fuck did he find me?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
Uh-huh.
Well, give it to me then.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
C'mon girl. Eat up.
Get away from her.
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
What is it?  How does it work?
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Adrian -- you've lost it.
That is amazing. What year is it?
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
Shu Lien...
Save your strength.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
What!
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
Damn... Are you alright?
They took my daughter.
I know.
But I'm not a killer!
A home --
So what's your novel about?
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
What's the title?
"The Day After Yesterday."
Oh. You mean... today?
Um... yeah but it's more...
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Yeah. Thanks.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
A paper?
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Well...
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Sure.
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
Petty good.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
College?
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
What's that?
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
My what?
This way.
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
Surprise me.
Stay out of it, Sefton.
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
Finish, please!
This is going to give you nightmares.
Thanks, honey.
What's wrong?
I'll never be able to do that.
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
Expecting anyone?
No.
What's up?
Just wanted to say good game.
But?
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Thanks.
I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
I didn't have my camera with me.
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
Carl --
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
It's a lovely outpost.
There it is, guys, the last of it.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
What was the top bid?
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
You still spooked?
I wasn't spooked.
Lies.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
Probably Mister Riddle.
He was watching me.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
He can still watch.
I might actually get the pasta special.
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Mother!
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
You're willing to die for this.
It's on the television.
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Still working on it.
Elly Kedward?
It's my lucky day.
Hi.
Want to buy a bed?
What do you remember about the accident?
Pardon me?
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
The picture's dead.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
You looking for me?
Where's the damn wire?!
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Would you like to talk about it?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
Why should they?
I don't know.
Do you remember the night they said it came?
No. I was sick.
How were you sick?
Something I ate.
Did it hurt?
Yes.
Where?
Down... there.
And what did you do?
I went to my room.
And what happened?
I got sicker.
And then what?
I fell asleep.
In the middle of all the pain?
Yes.
Where did the baby come from?
What baby?
The baby they made up.
From their heads...
Is that where they say it came from... ?
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Where'd it come from before that?
From God.
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
I... I don't understand.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Don't you know?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Then let's talk about something else...
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Agnes...
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Would you like to ask them?
What do you mean?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Anything?
Will you marry me?
Marry you?
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
What about you?
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Get that ladder up here.
All right  all right.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
We do!
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
The Queen has consented?
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
With grenadine, right?
When I was twenty.
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
I object, your Honor...
Overruled...
Exception!
Interview over, Blattis ...
How do you remember this stuff?
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
No comment!
Oh?
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
What do you want?
Your advice!
They didn't offer you the job yet.
I want your feelings about it.
Right now?
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
Not without Jamie.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Hello..
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
Oh, my God.
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
What year is this?
How are the parental units functioning these days?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
I will be back in a few days.
How many?
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
I meant Sally.
I meant Sally.
Oh.  You're serious.
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
It was okay?
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
Get out of here, Jake.
All I did was kiss the girl.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
I don't know.
Maura, what is this!
We're not going.
What the hell happened?
If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
These look quite fresh.
Hold it...!
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
What elders?
Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
What does he know?
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
That could be anybody's.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
What are they saying?
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
Does this assignment interest you?
What.  What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone...
They stole the phones.
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
They missed the boat.
Thanks.
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
IT WAS MY TURN!
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Who is she?
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
Man knows what he likes.
Lookin' good.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
That'd be my guess.
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
I'm not going.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
Yes, I am.
Dick-weed!
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
What are you talking about?
Josh said...
All he did was kiss me....
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
...ergency procedures.
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
It was too noisy.
I'm going to miss you.
Oh, Rosie.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
Try harder.
There was no need to kill her.
Then where is she?
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
It concerns his future!
A new <u>take</u> on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
The hell you are.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
You're too small to be Bogart.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Why are you so hostile?
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
It's not opinion.
Charm.
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
He's just exhausted.
Murphy to Epps.
Epps, over.
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
Where was the girl?
What?  What?
Just Erich.
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
I... I can explain...
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
I was going to tell him.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
To who?
Doesn't matter.
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Murdered?
Right here in Manhattan.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
Straight.
Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
Whatcha doin' over there?
Gotta go.
How come?
All that you say comes down to the same thing.  You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
What'd you do?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
I guess he got the message...
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
No, no, I wasn't trying.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No. Life is too short.
No, I'm not worried.
Good.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Sure.
No, I mean, no one.
Hey, you know me.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
Yeah.
Uh, last night...
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
No, no.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
No.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Oh, and guess who showed up.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
I know, man.
You know?
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
What, they're looking for her?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Y- s-sure it did.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Wait. Hey, man.
Erica is in the van back there.
What?
Look.
Hey, man.
She's in the van.
What she doin' in the van, man?
Buff...
What?
She's dead.
She's dead?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Tim...
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Bullshit.
No, no, no.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Yeah, man.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
This is good. Uhh...
Loretta.
Where'd Johnny find you?
He knew my husband who died.
How'd he die?
Bus hit him.
Fast.
Instantaneous.
When you get engaged?
Why are you trying to hurt me?
You!
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
Turn that thing off.
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
Okay.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
Okay, okay.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
I don't need one.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
No, you don't.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
It'll never work.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Since when did that matter?
Let's not start that again.
My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?
I can't find it.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I lost it. I lose everything.
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
What're you saying, Charlie?
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
Twelve years.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
So?
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
You do know how to drive?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
It dies. We live.
You're an animal.
That's true. What are you?
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
What you say?
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
Then they may read about me.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Is that not enough?
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
Ellis Loew.
What about him?
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Twenty-two years ago.
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
The truth shall make you free.
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
Yes you are.
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
That's because --
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Oh, no.
Well, who are you, then?
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
No no no no no.
Why not?
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
It's polyester.
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
Male or female?
Female.
Let's do it here.
What about him?
I wasn't too over the top?
No, it was the perfect level.
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
It's not even a mile.
We should have driven.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Whoa.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
So you're going to stop acting?
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Uh-huh.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
If that's what feels right.
It does. Feels right.
Then it's a good thing.
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
The elevator broke.
Where's Applejack?
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
His first 'whiff'!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Praetor...
It's locked!
Can we go yet?
Go???
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
What time is it?
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Alex?
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
What are you going to see?
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Do you have bad dreams, too?
Some, everyone does.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
...the damn thing...
Good.
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
I have to.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
Rye.
Just coffee.
Never mind.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
That wasn't her toe.
Whose toe was it, Walter?
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
The nail polish, Walter.
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
But Walter--
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
What about the toe?
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
Last show of the night.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
No.
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
What about Don?
Engaged.
I want to see him.
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Are my seams straight?
I'll say.
What?
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
Are you alright?
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
You get anything on Smith?
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
No thanks, Carl.
Hey, you left your book back there.
Long gone, huh?
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
About me?
Well, what do you think?
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
I don't think so.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
Look what the cat dragged in.
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
You did it at your house?  Your own house?
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
In love?
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
But you haven't written your novel.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
Where did you find this?
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Where has all our beer gone?
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
How much beer?
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
Wait!  There's people down there!
There's people up here!
Get it out of here!
Oh Lord!
That fool. That damn fool.
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
Should I bring him in.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Is that the entire message?
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
What about the Powwow Safe?
What?
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
Welcome to Rome, sir.
You... gonna take... the money?
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
All right -- where's the letter?
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
What are you talking about?
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
Shall I call the police, sir?
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
I don't care. Something's going on.
What's she doing here?
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
What do you say, sir?
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
Why?  Is he staying?
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
I don't believe that.
We don't want to be disturbed.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
If you want to see us you must come later.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
How 'bout you?
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
But ain't no reason--
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Well, we want good stuff.
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
Midge.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Foley's got it.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
Ammo! Get the ammo!
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
Hey, guys...
We gotta play with more bullets.
We what?
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
More bullets in the gun?
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?
My mother.
Firing range, sir.
Purpose of visit?
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
You're late.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
Real charmer.
I'll take you down there.
Is, uh... Is he okay?
Mission accomplished.
Kyle, don't go!
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
They've burned through the outer shields.
Alex?
Yes?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Of course.
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
You can't.
There must be some way.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Which one are you?
Whitefoot, of course.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Is that what you think?
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
We need to talk.
I'm late for surgery.
It's important.
Are you the star of this picture?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
The kid is amazing.
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
I'm very sorry.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!
I know. I know.
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
They help me understand why we fight.
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
The homelesses?
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
I don't know.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Barnett, please -
What's wrong honey.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Don't feel that way, honey.
Then why are you listening to her -
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
You have to what?
So where are you?
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
This isn't working out.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
"We're" not over-reacting.
Could you watch Jango?
No.
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
"The Strawberries"?
What happened to you?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
Tom...
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
How is your -- personal life?
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.
Thank you.
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
...owe you.
Why?
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
Over.
Let's get the kid home.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
No one has ever dumped me.
Nothing. Still nothing.
It's been months. It's not like him.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
So have I
I should go. I should leave today.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Go ahead. Stun me.
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
...CUT OFF !
That wouldn't interest you.
Where's Tyler?
The first rule of Project --
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
And then?
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
Is it--?
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
Drive!  Drive away!
Will you, Judy?
How much time?
How was school today?
Fine.
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Cinn?
Would you like to do me?
I just might.
Yeah. Do you paint?
No.
Crayons?
This is a real piece of shit.
Tell me what you really think.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
What does?
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
What is?
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
--Well, maybe that means you.
What's that?
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
What is it?
What's that for?
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
Thank you.
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
For a blur?
Who is it?
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
What wockers?
The wockers with the knockers.
Wockers with the knockers???
I'd come back--
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Really, that's a long time.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Yikes.
What?
The little Brenner girl.
Lois!
It's Alice, ain't it?
No, it's Lois!
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
What the hell is that?
Well then, perhaps you also ---
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
She's unconscious.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
Huntington Beach, California.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Girl, what are you doing?
Watching TV.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Research.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
Wait and see.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
I gotta stay up, Max.
Jennifer --
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
Huh?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
Don't you have children?
Your breasts feel larger.
They do? Oh no...
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
She's nice lookin'.
So what.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
What d'you mean, any happier?
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
Shall I answer it?
Which one were you aiming at?
Private eye?
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
What are your rates?
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
...You don't like the music out there?
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
He is?
Yes.
He is.
He is.
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
Seems like it.
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
No Jeffrey!!
Daisy. How did you know?
I told you, I knew your sister.
You killed that cop Dutton.
Sir.
Any luck?
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
Ohh!
You know.
I know, no--  I know.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
Mr. Pekurny.
Yes?
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Mm...  Oh, man...

What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
Really? They were..
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
What... Powwow...
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
Preparation for what?
What is this?
Annie made them.
Who's Annie?
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
I don't like cake.
It's for the party, Dad --
Oh, the goddam party --
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
We like to think so, yeah.
I can't get power, sir!
Please, have a seat.
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
They smell.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
The what?
The Cretaceous.
Anything else, you old fossil?
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
You fucking see that!
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
Do you dance?
What?
Do you sing and dance?
Eh, no.
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
They were jealous of him.
Why?  Because he had you?
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
<i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television.
Is there any way out of it?
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
What about England?
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
Please stop -- please!
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
What's wrong, Skipper?
Mademoiselle.
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
Commander.
Oh huh...
...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u>, and...
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
I'm just talking about the Hats.
The hats.
A beret.
Why a beret?
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
When do I get to see Brad?
By the way  what happened to your leg?
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
You're tough, all right.
You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
So do I.
Holy shit.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Consider me ungrateful.
Its I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
Shell get over it.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
It makes it all seem so serious.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
To ask her to dance.
She's the King's cousin.
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
What?
Your offense?  Why are you here?
I don't want to talk about it.
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
Not really, no.
No?
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Why not?
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
Let me go home.
No.
Let me go home.
No.
I'm freezing to death.
You're making a scene!
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
You can't. Death is God's will!
I resent God's monopoly.
That's blasphemy!
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
No. He had more important work.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
Yes. I was there with Ben.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Well, I don't.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
I'll take my chances.
Where's luther?
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Jesus, Lindsey--
Bud, something really important is happening here.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
This is crazy.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
How should I know?
Zaltar. Use the wand!
And your charming little daughter?
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
How is gregor?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
I mean breakfast.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
Pritchett!
Don't go.
This is important to me.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
He trusts you to lock up?
I figure we'll get along just fine.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Thanks.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
Yeah.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
Yeah.
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
No.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
No, not at all.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
I DIDN'T...
Then who did?
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
He -- He made me do it --
Do what?
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
And Dieter?
Deranged.
Does it bother you to hear?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?

It's time.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
Where are you going?
To get my money.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Is it possible...?
How do you get out of the house?
I walk out.
I was drying out.
Can we go sit somewhere?
How long?
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
How quaint.
So, are you on for the next one?
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Why, didn't they say?
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
You want to go back to shuttle work?
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Feeling better, Oz?
I'm such a loser.
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
You might be right.
When'd you get to town, Raines?
The other day....
What for?
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Where you been, anyway?
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
You seem a little hinked-up ...
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
What do you think?
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
How is he?
Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'!  You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
It can wait.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
Are you done?
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
I'm sorry but ...
You remember Samuel, my son.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
You really think Eddie killed her?
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
'Bootstrap?'
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
That's not true.
I swear, you look just like him.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Funded by whom?
Max.  This is Anna.
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
He has a point.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Excuse me, sir...
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
A mental case?
I'm sorry...
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
I know.
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Hello, Benjamin.
No.
No what?
No.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
He's been cooked-off
Is he dead?
Take it to him.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
What happened?
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
And I'm not even pretty.
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
Blow where?
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
How can we?  We're broke.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
But this is so humiliating.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
Me?  After Sugar?
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
Thanks.
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
What about "60 Minutes."
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
Step aboard, Carolyn.
I can't....I can't....
Here. Make it easy on you.
Don't do this to me....
Just give me your hand.
But they...they could still be....
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
Jill.
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
You have no right to do this.
Well if I don't who will?
They're happy like this.
Should we say a little prayer first?
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
They barely talk anymore.
You're kidding?
Don't give him any more.
How soon can we get something?
Jimmy.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
Reef!
So they caught up with you, too?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Kicker!
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
Me first!
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Where are they taking him?
Where's the name sheet?
Nobody's named this one yet.
Yeah?
Sorry I'm late.
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
A block of ice.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
What do you see?
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
Who didn't?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
You love me?
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
We have to have a long talk about all this.
Hello, Eddie.
Hi. How's business?
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
You know everybody, don't you?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Sign up.
Where do I sign?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
What happened to you anyway?
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
I been thinking.
Thinking about what?
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
Rizzo, you okay?
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Fine. Have a seat.
Boy, it stunk in there.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Why are you here?
Am I not welcome?
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
No one's perfect, Kate.
And he is living proof.
Is he - is he gonna die...?
Where the hell are we?
It looks like the furnace.
Let's get outta here.
You amaze me.
Thanks, man.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
You were awfully good.
Do you understand German?
I read the hospital report on your client.
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
Believe me, we need to.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
Yeah... I guess so...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
Fuck me...
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
...give evidence.
What about Cooper--where is he?
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
Get them out of here!
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
So how would you put it?
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
This is ogre's magic.
Blackheart?
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
Where are my supplies?
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
Mary -- Jabez --
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
What is it?
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
4:25.
Right. April 25th.
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
I made my choice, Lenny.
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
When are you coming home?
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
Never will again.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
You mean this chocolate cake?
Why... why didn't you tell me?
And Bill?
Yes?
I'm needing lunch.
Not really.
Is there something we can do?
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
Up an' at 'em, Taber.
What's going on?
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
That was cool.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
What are you saying?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
How's it going?
Paris -
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
You're cool.
No.  You say you're cool.
Missed you, cousin.
You're disturbed.
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
The cartoon?
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
Yeah.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Right.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
Right.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
But the sword could be in his compound.
Take this flare.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
What about it?
Any idea where it is?
Little place called "Williams," why?
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Yes -- sort of...
That's nice.
What?
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
No, MR. Danvers.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
Okay, number 23's full.
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
Let's look anyway.
Lord, you're stubborn.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
Yes, sir.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill  or frightened.
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
No, she's got epilepsy.
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
I haven't drunk this much since-
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
Was that you?
Who did you think?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
I can't believe that.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
What about the documents he promised?
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
Did he pay you for this?
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.
I will, thanks.
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
These aren't just...
Out! Leave the table!
What?
You heard me: leave the table!
Thank you.
What should you have known?
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
What answers?
They do to!
The timing was off -- I need this light.
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
Hold lunch!
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
Your old files -- ?
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Come on --
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
When we gonna double back?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
No, I'm look --
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
Could I ask some questions?
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
Not a prayer.
Let him finish, Charles.
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
How will they know we're coming?
Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.
Nice work.
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
You want to go down or stay along the river?
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
What's all this for?
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
Oh... it's a game.
A game?
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
What kind of vacation?
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
We provide whatever's lacking.
And if nothing's lacking?
May I make two suggestions... ?
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
You okay?
Oh Clayton.
Did I hurt you?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Need some help?
I feel like a jerk.
Excuse me?
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
I am as well as can be expected.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Was a member of...?  Speak up?
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
What time are you gonna pick me up?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
Okay.  I will, too.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
And he mailed it to Hardy--
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
Why me?
I need someone with your kind of background.
My kind of background?
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
Hullooo!
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Just someone from New Hampshire!
I've tried it.
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
He's dead isn't he?
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
He came to kill us.
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
You knew he was coming.
No.
I trusted you.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
I didn't know this would happen.
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
Oh, Jesus...
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
But the police --
-- there's no time --
-- we'll explain it --
-- how? --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- forget it --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
What the heck is this?
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
You are the same?
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Yes.  Always.
Does it change with me in the room?
It is less.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
Through a window.
The windows don't open.
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
Do you like baseball?
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
What about camping?
What about it?
Do you like it?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Mother, you know, I can see right through you  right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
What else did you see- Michael...?
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
What the fuck is that?
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
What is it?
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
So what?
Who the hell are you?
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
Willard...
It's not a guy...
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
Bet a nickel!
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
Where's he living these days?
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Address?
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
How much longer?
Shhh!
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
Dad!
Do I know you?
Where've you been?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Who won the fight?
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
Yeah.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
What the hell is this?
Thanks for coming by.
I could take some time off....
You're always taking time off....
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
You can't have water after morphine.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
How's the pain?
How's yours?
I can handle it.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
What Truth?
My husband's dead, isn't he?
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
What have you done with his body?
Yes.
Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
Yes.
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
Dristan nasal spray.
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Three fifteen.
A.M -- or P.M.?
P.M.
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
Don't ever do that again.
What do we got?
How much is it?
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
What are you sorry for?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
I want to go home.
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
No... I don't think so, man.
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
Whattaya mean family?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
And?
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
Elliot lusts after you.
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
Koontz!  I need you guys!
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
What's that for?
Nothing.
I'm cooking you dinner.
You don't have to do that.
I know.
Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading, I reckon somebodyll pick you up.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...
Joey?
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
He didn't do it -- Nick!
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
So where are you?
I almost didn't.
Where's Jake?
McKendrick's men got him.
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
What did he say?
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
...And I said, shut up!
He's the devil's child...
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
What?  What are you talkin' about?
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
What's up guys?
Why don't you beat off at your house?
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
I pushed him too hard.
You couldn't have known --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
You wanted to get the truth.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
Weir can't be alive.
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
You two timing psychotic bastard.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Do I?
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
That's right.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
What position did you occupy?
What are you afraid of?
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Out of the mouths of babes.
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
Can we get out of here?
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
How do you open the damn door?
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
That's not entirely --
Then what? My boobs are too big?
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
Hello.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
Shouldn't you answer that?
A late night or an early morning?
Late night.  You?
Were you with Jamie?
Yeah.
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
Nothing.
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
-- Yes.
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
How careful should I be?
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
I thought you said the line was busy?
I tried again and got through.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
So, how was I?
They don't have the package.
You think?
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
I don't really like to drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.
There's just one more thing.
What's that?
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
What in the hell... do you call that?
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
I should go get some of her things.
No, let me go.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
There is something very not normal going on here!
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
Objection!
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
Man, fuck you!!!
You seem fascinated by the stars.
You can see so many here.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
You do!
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
That's forgotten.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
Hi, Jennifer.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Hi, how are you?
You were standing in the middle of the street?
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
I love that dream.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
But he saw you, right?
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
I see where you're going.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
I'd go with the seven.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
How do you guarantee that?
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
May I ask where your two warders are?
So, what do you do for a living?
I'm a dancer.
Really? Ballet?
No. Exotic.
Oh. Sorry.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Exactly. A dance.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
Yes, monsieur?
What happened to your face?
Got in a little accident.
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
All right!  What'd she say?
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
I'm sorry.
You don't look it.
No. Really, I am.
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
The line's over there.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
How is it you're good? You on a list?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
You're a beast!
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
Why him?
What was this desperate urge to see me?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Oh... this and that.
What I've been doing?
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Fuckin' asshole.
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
You going to turn State's?
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
A little after eleven.
Why did you come by?
I had some papers to pick up.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Goodnight.  See you home.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Just that she got away.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
The royal...studs?
What the hell're you talking about?
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
Wait a minute --
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
Oh my god.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
Charlie! Am I dead?
What do you want?
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
Come again?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
Where's Erica? You seen her?
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Oh, How'd she get back?
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word.
M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.
Okay. Never argue with a man.
A car ... a car accident.
Are you okay?
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Yeah...you a witch?
Have a shot?
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
Alright, okay.  Look...
What?
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
You, me and White, huh?
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
Hi, Artie.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
In a deep freeze.
You wrote this?
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
However many.  It's not enough.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Got it!
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
Where are the miners?
No questions.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
You've made your decision then7
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
Australia.
Who is it?
Annina Nosei.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
That your daughter?
Uh-huh.
Got her mother's looks.
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
My mother's told me all about you.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
What's wrong with me?
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
Was she married or something?
Yes.
With a family?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Did they ever find out?
No.
And it's all over now.
Yes.
Are you alright?
Just a little queasy...
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Right.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
Give what up?
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
I don't want it.
He says this is their block.
As in, they own it?
Something like that...
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
I didn't know that you spoke French.
Back off, man.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
What's his name?
Fumitsu.
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Go to hell.
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
What're you gonna do?
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
Not really to live, just to play.
That building?
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
Right.
Hmm?
You were convicted of the crime.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
Hold station...!
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Yes?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Stop it...
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
Hey, you still here?
What now, sir?
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Can I stay a bit longer?
Stay forever.
Tell me what, boy?
Nothin'!
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
Does it bother you?
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
Yes, of course.
You know how people talk.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Not that I have anything to hide.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
So who won?
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Why didn't you come in?
Dad, I don't know about this one --
Oh, you're changing your mind --
No, I'm not, but --
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
Can you move at all?
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Well ... you were dead.
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
I will never doubt again.
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
It's incredible who's here.
Who?
Max made a deal with you?
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
You're sure about this?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
You tell me.
I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
Yes?  What is it?
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
Why, what's wrong?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
What do you mean?
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
He was caressing.
Phil for God sake.
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
Oh...what's that?
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
I love you, Jez.
I know.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
Remember that.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
How come? The army?
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
Ch...
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
Right.
You can see why it's sensitive?
You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
She must be something special After Dark.
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
Do you wish to be baptized?
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Should I...
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
Security consultant.
Where?
Government. Recently retired.
Where in government?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
Where?
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
What're you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
Every Russian family has one..
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Thanks for your help.
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
I am not.
How much can you bench?
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
I know.
Then why have you come?
Hmmm?
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
So you were unhappy?
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
Please?
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
Is it true?
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Died there?  How?
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
A nun?
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
What's that?
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
God....damn you, Rhodes!
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
So what's the scam, Eddie?
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
I won't say anything.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
Five times.
I had it at four.
Are you asking me a question?
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.
Pass.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
What if our guys open up, sir?
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
Hi. Is Annette at home?
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
Well, I'm in school and --
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
Martin, look at me.
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
That's a nice name for what you need...
Why don't you help me?
Because I don't have time.
Why not?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
And how do you know that?
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
You didn't ask.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
I don't want them now.
I'll not denounce you.
I know.
So --
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
And now?
For God's sake, what happened to me?
Had?
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
How long ago?
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
What about him?
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Mom?
Yeah?
Maybe they should put me down too.
What?
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
Are you all right?
I think I busted my leg.
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
What does that mean?
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
Should we get a what?
points at the motel.
Where?
What have you got in your hair, girl?
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
I just wanted to say hello.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
I wanted to talk.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
What about us?
There is no us, remember?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
Stop it.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Because I know you're full of shit.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
Yes.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
He stole my wheel!
This is pathetic.
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
Yeah I can't.
Why?
I have work, I can't leave.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
When?
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
One of whom?
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
Honey... you all right?
No.
Are you scared?
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
Mind your own business, Peaches.
Then why won't she call...?
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
You've heard of the PEM114...
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Uh-huh.
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
A soap?
A daytime soap opera.
And?
I was too old.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
Bledso
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
He still living?
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
You've heard this story before?
How's the new one coming?
The play? All right, I guess...
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Twentyish. It isn't important.
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
How do you mean?
Don't be evasive.
Margo, you haven't got any age.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
I buy that.
He is totally crunching on you.
Do I want to be crunched?
Are you ready for me?
MMMMmmmmm!
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
Who you calling?
Shhh... Hello, room service?
C'mon, man...
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
How much is it?
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
How much was it?
Forty-six.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.
Great. On my fucking room.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Oh really. Why's that?
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
Why would my father send this to me?
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
If I had known --
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
He can be no other.
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
... she's very upset...
What about, tonight?
You were right.
... I was right about what?
Hold on a second!
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
I should talk this over with your husband.
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
'Tis but a scratch.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
No, it isn't.
Well, what's that then?
I've had worse.
You're a liar.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
Who are you?
I'm a lawyer.
You can't come here.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
No.
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
And why haven't they left each other?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
You walked home.
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
It was not my intent --
Right....
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
You are truly magnificent!
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
About the conspiracy?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
What is with this school and prom?
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
We're all set,  sir.
What about the intro?
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
The one with the V.P.L.
V.P.L.?
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
There are no twos, Max.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
M'hm.
And... uh-
We have to go back for Daddy!
Daddy's dead.
What is it?
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
Aah!
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
Yes!
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
I'm sorry.
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
Saavik... Is... David with you?
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
You got what we need?
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
No names, this is an open line!
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
Now, look...
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Where we going?
Tom, where are you going --
Home, I'm done.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
I'm fine.
Are those just button buttons or...?
That's good
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
I know you did.
I knew you'd know.
I know you knew I'd know.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
Nuts. He made it.
No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Sure, but...
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Want a cup?
'Predate it.
How fresh is this coffee?
It's beautiful.
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
May I help you?
Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
How are ya?
Nope.
I don't know about this, Dom.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
His mother?
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
And you have him?
Finally, some common sense...
What do you mean?
I think you know what I mean.
No, I really don't.
I think you do.
Why don't you tell me?
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Okay--
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.
That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
Uh huh.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
France.
How long is the voyage?
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
Who are you?  What do you want?
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
My Mom's at that.
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Which one?
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
What happened?
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class.  You'll be envied by everyone.
I guess so.
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
Ah fuck it.
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
She understands.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
You're not stupid.
You're serious?
Anything for a dear friend.
But I just met you.
When's the next Jumbo?
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Anything else?
Mr. Mulder.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
What's the matter here?
I begged him to let me put that on!
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
How do you do.
How do you do.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
A ship,
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
What do you mean gone?
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
Why didn't someone tell me!
We aren't completely stupid.
Then who changed it?
I came in the front.
How bad off is he?
I can look and see.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
See.  That's my name.
It's my name too.
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Are you and Larry happy?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
All the time...
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
And this innocent child.
It's kind of dark -
I think he knows that Joey.
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Came to my senses.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
Do you know he won't expel him?
No. But I don't think that matters.
Buffy?
What about the mainframe's access code?
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Unfortunately.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
Go on.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
Morning!
Morning.
So? How'd it go last night?
With who?
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
What for?
Cindy, what's going on?
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
What ?
You took an awful big risk back there.
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
We've got powder but no ball!
Oh, it's on, baby...
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
Kill me...
What did it do to you?
Son of a bitch!
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
My card.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
Why wasn't I insulted?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
Then I demand an apology!
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
She did.
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
It's kind of embarrassing but,
Go ahead.
I had a dream about this place.
Oh boy.
You see what I mean...
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
Thanks for helping.
Not at all.
Why are you?
I like it when they wake up.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
Why?
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
So you take their best...
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
You took her because she helped me.
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
No, don't go...
If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.
I have to do something.
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
I said I have to do something.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
How long will it take you to get home?
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
I'm sorry honey, but...
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Damn.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
Six one.
Take it easy, baby.
You're late, Cartman!
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
Your behind?
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
Did you bring the pie and punch?
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Know what?
You described the exact contents of my purse.
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
Don't pay any attention to her.
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
Attic space.
Who is it?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
What'd it say?
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
Tell me now.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
Get me a plane...
Wait, Will...
Get me a plane!
I'll pick you up in...
Walter...stay away from me!
Where to?
I know a guy.
Where is everybody?
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
I don't believe it.
I'm half Irish.
What is that?
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Haven't seen you around, have I?
No. I'm new in town.
You working?
What'd I tell you?
He's not at ground level.
Where's the radio?
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
Are we crazy?
Well...
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
That door is a safely hazard.
I'm sleeping in my room.
I see.
I'm not scared.
That's great.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
It's not me, moron.
Good morning.
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
Easy, Bill.
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
You don't want me.
Rheya.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
Wrigley!
Sorry.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I am very sorry.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
No. You're not.
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
Dr. Lecter -
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
You know I can't make that promise.
Coming up!  Give way!
I couldn't prevent it.
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
So you don't have anything concrete?
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
Have you just plain asked him?
I've asked him what's wrong.
And?
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Not if you remember my dad.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
You know it's not like that --
Just after Leland Street.
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Been where?
To Old Madrid.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Gary, I --
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Huh?
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Well, okay, it's -
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Yeah, you already said that.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
Okay.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Once is enough, thank you.
Hit your finger, huh?
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
What's all that wood?
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
How old is your cousin?
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
You mean Alex.
Yes.
And how would you describe him?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
Seemed...on edge.
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
This has nothing to do with him.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
How much time do you have?
What is wrong with you?
I've got eleven horses.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
Where have you been, Robert?
Sick.  The flu.
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
Not me. No way.
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
If you say so.
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
Not yet...how much further is it?
Okay.
Where are you going vit the light?
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
What show ?
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
I thought you were tinkering.
I just mean...
You okay?
How do I look?
Nice rack.  How old is --
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
'Big'?
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
I am Joe.
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
Don't be late.
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
Who, Laddie?
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
It was a dream, Star.
Kings and sixes.
That's good.
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
Huh? Uh... yeah.
I seen him.
He's dead, Bill.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Worms was comin' out.
Very good, busyboy.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
Oh yeah...
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
What about Jackie?
What about her?
I mean, how did that happen?
Lester, it just happened.
She's nothing but a whore.
No --
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
What? What do you want?
We have a man down...
Coop, where are you...
The containment, Second Containment...
Then there is another jungle?
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Sure.	In a cage.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Rough, huh?
Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
No?
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Not so good.
No?
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
These are all from me.
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Quiet!
Do you like talk like that?
No.
Are you sure you even packed it?
It's about the Three Musketeers.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
I found one.
Alive?
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
I actually got some memory back last night.
How much?
Enough.
What's there to think about?? That THING back there...
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
I heard you, Ma.
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
So. Do you have a name?
It's Esther.
How often does he get like that?
Whenever he's got an edge on.
How often is that?
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Considering what?
I can't seem to let go of you...
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Fifty's a nice round number.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Hey, Mikey!
Hi, Dad!
Come here, give me a hug!
Gee, you're home early!
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
How are you feeling?
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
Where did you here that?
Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
Take this off.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Sorry I--
It's okay. You need me?
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Were you provided with a gun?
Yes.
No.  Not true...
Stand back.
Sorry.
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
How're your hands?
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
What do we need another Shill for?
Say it again.
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
Do you sail?
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
I see.
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
Is that a fact?
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
Fire insurance!
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
Save it, I already took the tour.
Oh, how do you do?
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
I only saw Theo drive up.

Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
What's a demur?
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
Yeah.
We were in a car accident --
They were in a car accident.
But everybody is all right.
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
Jaeger?
What!?
You ever think about dying?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
J&B. Straight.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Are we here?
Yes.
This is Dorsia?
With your dry wit and humor--
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
What's he got that I haven't got?
Well, he has a straw hat--
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
--And he has sex appeal.
So what?
Get that out of your trunk.
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
Ha!!
But ... I called Central Services.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
Sorry ...
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
Yes, Lord.
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
Good idea, O Lord!
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
And why do you tell us this only now?
Jack, I think I should get a job.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
I know, but that was before.
You own a hotel, sir?
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
I have money --
I got money.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
Um-hum ...
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
Where am I at, man?
Let's go!
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
You ought to know why. Because
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Can't say that I do.
I don't know what I'm doing. I know he only likes me as a friend. He's just so...everything--I know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and I used to be a camp counselor...
Hopefully no one.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Kimberly!
Hello, Sean.
Come in.
Sean...
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
I don't know.
The hell you don't.
Five million?
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
Christmas... Eve...
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
No, sir.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
No water -- What a place!
Hello, Charlie.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Louise?  Where are we?
Just past Boise City.
Idaho?
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
TURK, leave him alone.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
We're pushing oxygen today.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
Wit-tay.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Accident.
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
What time is it?
Twelve
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Harry?
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
You and the Colonel go back.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Hello.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
What did I say?
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
I need your truck.

No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
...and a shitload of ice.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
...-tana.
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
...ya?
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
For cryin' out loud.
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
I need your help.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
...truck.
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
...-er.
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
And if that Elvis shit...
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
Peace.
All right.

Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
You want cash?
You want cash?
I got, like, uh....
I got, uh....
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
No.
All right, then how about this?
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
...doing?!
I need your truck!
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
I've seen a few.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
No.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
I... I need a drink of water.
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
What reputation?
Should we turn off the lights?
...would you like a drink?
No thank you.
And it's not right to the customers.
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
That's right?
Eh...?
That's right?
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
...that's right...
Eh?
No.  That's absolutely right.
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
...that's right...
Skipper...
What is it, Smith?
You saved my life.
I had to.
Thanks.
Is that true?
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
I hope you're well.
I need to talk.
Are you all right?
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
And if he's not?
What if I did?
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
A little?
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
You think you're gonna last all summer?
I miss you, Annie.
I know. We miss you too.
Good night.
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
Yeah, baby...
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
Aha. The Lovers.
...but first, you have to tell me something...
Anything... just ask.
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
For you, Trapper.
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
How different?
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
Do you think she'll be all right?
Okay, what's the information?
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Yeah?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
The Mask. Where is it?
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Guilty.
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
What the hell are these?
Mind if we sit down?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Detective...
Carter.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Yeah?  What do you need?
Me?
You just said everyone needs something.
I've got everything I need.
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
Don't belong?
Do you always have to repeat?
Sorry. 
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
You think people hate you.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Didn't want you.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her - something you never get hold of - something that keeps a man following after her.
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging - waiting  I feel as if I'd never known her.
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life  that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
Weren't you afraid?
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact - I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her  to see her  to touch her  in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
Oh?
You saved my life.
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Mr. Jameson--
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Mr. Jameson--
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Can I get a word in edgewise?
You're not safe on your own.
You think he's..?
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
Not according to the men in blue.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
You know my work?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
Jeffrey Wigand...
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Okay.
Anything you can tell me?
The criminals are winning.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Why do you do it?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
Thank you, no.
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
What about medical?
STOP! You're making...mistake.
It's your mistake.
The big job.
An elevator ?
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
All done.
Honey this is Father Dyer.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
Oh, is this Adele?
Yes, it is.
My Leica's gone.
So's the video camera.
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
Holy shit.
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
Mr. Lime - yes.
You remember me? Upstairs...
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
Hello Marge!
My Lord!
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
Could we sail to Venice?
Sure. I love Venice.
I have to go to Venice.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
And Rome.
What?
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
I guess it's possible.
So, what does the Russki want?
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
Glenn talked you out of it.
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
Fuck you.
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
I bet I would.
So tell me about yourself.
102  CONTINUED:
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
You could have a great beach house for that.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
I gather you're a decorator.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Where is it?
Upper West Side.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
You should try Adderall.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
I heard that was you.
God, I can't do this.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
How about some ginger pie?
Eh, fine.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
He's waitin' for you in the card room.
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
You missed somethin', Ed.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Why didn't he want to sell it?
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
Are you ready?
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
I'll always go back to that church.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
I found that out.
We learn from life.
That's why I'm here.
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
Where have you been?
You've done much of this work before?
Forget your pager?
What?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Don't forget these.
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
Options?
Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.
Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and...  His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.
You want more?
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
No.  It's nice and cozy.
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
Interesting.
Anything wrong?
No, no.
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
That's ridiculous.
And your head is hot.
That's ridiculous.
And you've got cold feet.
Isn't that ridiculous?
Did you find Rennie?
Presence.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
At a press conference.
What?
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Frankly, no.
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Haven't got a thing.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Where are we going?
Nowhere.
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
All tapped out.
Were the leads...
...what am I going to do all month...
What does that mean?
I'm terribly sorry.
What does this mean?  What does it --
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
P.A. What the hell is that?
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Anything you need.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
That's it?
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
And I can go free?
What did you say?
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
Yes you did.
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
Can't you?
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
I took it from my fake husband.
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
What more proof do you need?
When you come on, you really come on.
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
What the hell is this?
The freeway.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
Okay then...
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Not me. But other people seem to.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
What?
They can come to the concert in the park.
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
You've misunderstood.
Missile!
Sure. .
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
You did help a little.
Who drove the ice cream...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Who put the big hurt on...
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
You, Arlo.
Hello.
You.
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
Us.  Owes us.
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
Run!
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
I vote for me.
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
You're the asshole, buddy.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Toons aren't given imperfections.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
When?
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
I have school.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
Shut-up!
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
The baby I lost...
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
What is it?
"Theo?"
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
26th off Wilshire.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
He was... like him.
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
What about it?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Molecular-memory.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
This could be it!
She fucked us both.
Yeah.
Fucking women, man...
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
You're going to return every cent of it!
I can't! I haven't got it!
What did you do with the rest?
I never had it.
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.
It'll grow on you.
You okay?
Yeah, I guess so.
Really?
Down at the station?
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Did you now?  On which bounce?
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
That's enough, Edie.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
Not at all.
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
I've got patients coming in --
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Tell us every detail.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
Yes, Mama.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Sam!!! 
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
No, no, it was great.
How 'bout a back rub?
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
I'll tuck you in.
You can't seduce me.
Permission to leave, sir?
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
It's complicated...
Problems?
Is my money in there?
The Slaughtered Lamb?
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
That's a wolf's head.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
I assume full responsibility.
Okay.
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
What?!
It has a killer refresh rate.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
So you're just the thing we need.
Excuse me?
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
Maybe the maid did it.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
I trust you of course I do but --
But?  But what?
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
I can't help what I think.
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
You're an hour and a half late.
My watch is broken, too.
You and me, Tom.
Where are you going?
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
That's not true -- Where are you--?
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
Almost?
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
Listen. Maybe I should go...
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Cut that shit out.
She smiled baby.
That's not cool.
Did she, or did she not smile?
It doesn't matter...
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
You ready?
For what?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
What happened?
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
Is LESLIE here?
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
Good.   I'm good.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
What is this?
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
We were supposed to play golf.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Count me out.
Is something wrong?
What're we going to do?!
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
And what would be your motive?
Why are you trembling, dear...?
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
I hate this job.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
The war.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
I can't believe this is happening.
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
That's gonna take a long time!
Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
What happened to you?
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
Are you finished surfing?
Yeah... thanks.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
Nah.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
How was I? Tell me honestly.
You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?
Extremely clever.
you're very --- different.
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
Okay, okay.
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
How many?
It's you.
It's me?
Yes?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Who is this, Enid?
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
They're coming!
Nah.
I make my own luck.
Whoa.
Would you hold this for me?
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
Oh, the usual things...
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
What?
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Is that for me?
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
You mean--beyond pacifism?
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
sighs.
Can I go now?
Surprised to see me?
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Mexico.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Barbara.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Where are they?
Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
I've had some experience.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
What is it?
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
Slut.
Kiss me on the lips.
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
Ow.
Cramps?
None of your business.  God.
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
You sure you're comfortable?
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Yeah.
Me too.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
I hope you're going to invite me in?
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
But don't you have to work?
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
What is?
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Yes.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
No, sir, no response.
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
I want my car.
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Altar boys?
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Gee, it's easy.
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
Yeah.
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
I didn't mean to.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Dr. Evil?
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Mary again.
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Whatever happened to Mary?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I mean since then.
I don't know.
Well why don't you look her up?
Yeah, right.
Why not?
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
You're kidding? What did they say?
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Should I?
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
Yes.
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
The Big Boy did...?
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Huh.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
Me, too.
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
Maybe there was traffic.
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
We did it, Ray.
Would you like some?
No, Dad.
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
You would risk your life for strangers?
Not for strangers; for my country.
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
Yeah, like...
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
Think about it.
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
Bacon cheeseburgers.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
Such as.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
As long as you're okay.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
What's it to you anyway?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out like, and treat her -- properly.
Shag her senseless.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Right in front of the room.
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
Who are you ?
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
You knew her, didn't you?
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Uh-huh.
Who?
What'd you care?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
Ask him.
What about hard work?
How many times have you seen Frank?
Four times... so far.
Can anyone else see him?
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
A sign from whom?
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
How does that make you feel?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
Is Callie still around?
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
What happened?!
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
P.E.T.N ...
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
Charlie -
Yes?
It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
Open the door, will ya?
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Open the door. We're late.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Right.  No one else?
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
These THINGS... they want to take me --
What happened?
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
What deal?
We're a tiny version of all that?
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
I know, I know.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Yeah?
Understand me?
Just give me a minute.
Is there a problem?
I'm here.
Bill!  Bill?!
Patrick, he's...
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
Sit down here.
When we had trouble before it was different.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
What do you want to do?
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
Do you mean that?
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
You know what gets me?
Oh, shit.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
At least we found the diamonds.
At least!
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
Tell them yourself!
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
I didn't tell you everything.
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
This room is full of ghosts.
James...
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
Can I see you later?
Fight a bit of a cold..
And you're happy about that?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
I knew where it was.
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
Hey.
What's up?
I've been trying to find you all day.
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
Josie, I think we should go public.
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
What are you afraid of? What people think?
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
Fish eyes?
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
What am I gonna do?
What do you want to do?
I want to be an actor.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
-- my loss --
-- even if I give you a million as well?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
Getting ready to invade.
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
Spangler says we have a relationship.
What?
You and I -- a relationship.
I was wondering what that was.
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
Vada, we're trying to work here.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Will you shut-up!!!
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
So what? You going to help me?
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
for the rheumatism, you know.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
Shane's going as a condom.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Yes, sir.
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Thanks, Chuck.
Ben never mentioned it.
Hey, Guttierez?
What?
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
That's the original.  There are no copies.
I'll not going without my family.
It's Friday....
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
Where's your brother?
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
No. That's okay.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
What was it.  What was it, honey?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
...what?
John, you still there?
I'm right here, Dad.
You all right?
Yeah, I think so...
What?
Call the Coastguard?
No.  I'm just a little tired.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
I can't.  I have too much to do.
Dad?
Yes?
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
I do.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Don't do this.
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
Do you want to talk about it.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
No.  I mean your relationship.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
What's he talking about?
In college. A car accident.
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
You've worn a stillsuit before?
No.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
Hi Loretta.
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
You can't leave, George.
Why not? What's going to stop me?
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
You want me to call the doctor?
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
Let her go.
David?
Who's there?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Yes. We're suing.
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
Jesus, Teddy.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
I met this girl.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I don't know.
Did you tell Alice?
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
What d'you mean?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
What does that mean?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Yeah.
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
HOW MUCH TIME?
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
How much?
One way, or round trip?
One way.
No one would blame me if I left!
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
I'm not doing it!
It'll be fine.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
Light in those passages ain't so good.
Father...
Dr. Grant!
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Max, I've got a hit series.
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Lois, you're amazing.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
No.
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
You promised me!
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
How's your mother?
Al!
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Al!!
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
Here it comes....
Who grows more beautiful....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
I told you....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
Oh, Jake... 
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
That's my baby.
Morning, Sheriff.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Time marches on.
How much you got left?
Three months.
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
It was for personal consumption.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
Delano?
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
You're kidding me.
Sorry ...
Hey, I'm Sooze.
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
Stop it!
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
What's she doing?
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
That's unique.
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
Master safety.
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
I don't like people looking at me like that.
Like what?
So tell me... what happened here?
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
That's right.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
I love you so much, Leon.
What happened?
Why did you say those things?
Majesty!
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
Now take the rest off.
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
...or death.
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
Hi.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
I wrote that.
This looks done.
It's not done.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
Is that what's affecting your performance?
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
Proceed.
Ready?
Yeah.
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
How much.
One way, or round trip?
One way.
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
Never heard of him.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
Like you?
What was that??
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
Hello.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
Very well, proceed, sir.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
You want to talk about it?
What's the point?
There you are!
Jesus, Jim!
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
Just be careful.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
I like your hat.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
Please, we hardly know each other.
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
What is it?
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
Never will be much too soon.
Did he kill Freddie?
Marge, when did you get here?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Dickie did it.
Dickie?
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
What?
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
My God.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
I guess so.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Where, sir?
Estimate range, ship to whales!
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
A well-accepted theory.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
Twenty-five.
We're waiting.
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
Committed to memory.  Forever.
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
And you said...
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Oh, really?
Bigger and better.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
You feel alright today, Daddy?
How is it looking, Mac?
What'd he say?
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
Do tell. Why drug related?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
No shit?
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Nope.
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Who is he?
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
It ain't the law!
Hokey enough for you?
Somebody else is going to get it.
I don't care.
Penny for your thoughts.
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
Beautiful.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
A bad idea.
I got us through the War all right.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
No!... No!
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
Birdies... pretty...
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
Immune from what?
You shall see.
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
What is it?
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
Shields, aye.
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
What?
There's only one key.
We'll take it!
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
I want a second opinion.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
What are you doing?
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
So what?
They're not that Jewish.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
What do you mean?
Counselor.
Do you have a moment, sir?
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
Yes.
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
This interview's over! The militia stays!
This murder was in the papers, right?
Yeah.  All over.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
When was the last time?
Why?
Give it to me.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
Give it.
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Against what?
Against anything. Just protest.
You got me.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Yes!
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied
Wanna play?
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
Why... why... why... ?
Why what?
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
You need me.
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
Make it official, if you like.
What is your nationality?
"Money." So you can get dome money...
I can try.
"Really?"
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
"So... surprise"...
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
Where'd you get all these riders?
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
You okay, Jesse?
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
I guess so.
What we gonna do?
Was that it? Well, ok.
What kind of test?
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
Oh, but I am!
-- words alone are insufficient.
Why does he wanna see me?
Lose the hardware now.
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
I told you he was a sore.
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Where's Johnny?
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
You give him his drops?
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" -
What makes you think that?
Who is...'V'ger'...?
V'ger is that which programmed me.
What the fuck is going on?
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Oh, that's gonna work.
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
What happened?
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
What caused it?
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
Why... yes.
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
Wow.
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
Coffee.
We're locked in.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
Got a smoke?
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
Be quiet.
Where've you been?
Never mind that, where are we now.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
Gimme a minute.
Johnny, this is Zander.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
Cool it, Andy.
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
We're going to do this.
You have to say that.
Well...What do you say?
MMMMmmmmm!
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
I'm missing two!
Come on.
No. No, no, no.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
What are you wearing?
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
What? 
What?
God, these parties are the worst
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
And?
Everybody loves trout.
Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
You grow fond of him.  That's good.
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
He already knew it.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I'm thinking about producing.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
No, really, I really like him a lot.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Excuse me.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
It could be nothing.
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
Yes.
Well, look who's dressing for success.
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
Meaning...???
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
And your only goal is...???
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
So that...???
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Yeah, she's nice.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
You wasn't with her, were you?
Huh?
You wasn't with her?
With her? How?
You know, like bang her or anything?
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
Yes, sir.
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
Will you quit moving around?!
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
Jesus!
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Stephen ready?
How about this?
That's not bad.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
I believe it.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Yes.
Do you know what you're going to do?
No.
Are you going to graduate school?
Oh, what's that?
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
Oh, Jesus, no--
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Just a favor for your old man.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
Oh . . . my . . .
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
So am I.  And I mean you no harm.
No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
I didn't do too well for you.
No, you did fine.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Money.
Jack doesn't need money.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
Nonsense.  What next?
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
You don't understand...
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Pull it apart!
What?
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
This rope is sixty years old!
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
Never
Never, what?!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
How am I a hypocrite?
Can you get me that ring back?
No.
Please -- just let me sleep.
No. Just pool.
You Hoto?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
Did your husband know Quaid?
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
You don't?
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
But-
HARRY!
Thank you, Jimmy.
I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
No no, I'm fine, really...
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
...Keep going. Don't stop.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
It's all right.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
Hello, Hal.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
You never were together, Hal.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Clyde.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
Home, sweet home.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
Gibarian.
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
What do you think you're doin'?!
These shoes are itchy.
Norman!
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
That's what I do.
Seen a lot of islands?
Quite a few.
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Anti social?
Self sufficient...
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Pleasantville Marathon?
Yeah. Every episode ever.
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
What kind?
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Easy tiger.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
Scout's honor.
Then you explain it to me?!
There's nothing to explain
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
I will not defend my life to you--
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
There is nothing to discuss-
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
I've never brought anyone down here before.
I'm honored.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
What's this?
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
In what way, pray tell?
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
You did?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Maybe it's time you got out.
Me?
You.
Okay.  Okay.
You're an imbecile.
I know you think that.
Everybody thinks that.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
I don't think so.  It could have been.
If what?
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
They were enemies.  We were at war.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
Are you an actress?
Just a waitress.
I'll be right back.
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
Smith.  Hampshire....
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
Yeah.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
You ain't dying, he is.
I'll call somebody.
Who?
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
Where's Leeloo?
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
Strategically.
It never rains but when it pours --
-- you the resident here?
Yes.
You feeling better Franny?
Marcus!  I did it!
Oooooh, I'm good.
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
I woke up naked, too.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
What does it say?
It says, "Ray."
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Get out?! What does it say?
"Fucked me."
Viva la Resistance.
Oh no, it's that kid.
Yes!
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
Where are you?
Food-storage room!
That really happened?
Thank. you, Master Control.
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
Rex. Get away from the door.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
We are. And it's winding down.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Marylin?
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
I don't know what you're talking about.
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
I'll get it, Jabez.
Whadaya say?
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
Deals?
It's isolated.
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
I wasn't helping you for money.
My, that fudge smells yummy!
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
My friend the clitoris told me.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
He talked to you?
I think I better take you home.
What about those other guys you live with?
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
What about?
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
You're not...
You did good...
What?
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
-- we're kidding ourselves.
-- we are?
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
Why?
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
I'11 meet you in the car.
Tom?
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
I see.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
You wish to close this account today?
That's correct.
How would you like the funds?
American currency.
This will take some time.
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Yah, so we're all set.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
Yah, well, they exist all right.
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Yah, how much money was that?
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
No, no, fax is -
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Okay.
WAKE UP!
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
What about him?
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
You won't live to see it.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
Oh really?
And what can you tell us about this... 
I thought about that.
Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
For who?  The fish?
Won't be time if he gets access --
You put filth in my child's mouth.
Aw.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
Goodbye...
Goodbye.
It could have been marvelous ...
Divine ...
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
But it could have been glorious.
Lovely.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Nice shot.
That's right.  What's she doing?
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Oh --
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
No money, eh?
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
And cunning.
And what do you do about it?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Pity.
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
Yes.
See you.
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
What?
I can't.
I know. I'm sorry...
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
Clementine.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
What the hell's going on?
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
How many bottles?
Not sure. Ten?
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
Possibly.
You?
Yes, Amy.
But why?
Good mornin', Nathan.
Mornin'...
You ready to eat?
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
Yeah?
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
What did you do at night?
Don't, I'll drink it.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
And have you something to settle with me?
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
Where are you, ol' buddy?
Can't find the shotgun.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
What were you, following me?
How do you reconcile the two?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
Explain it so I can.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
I don't think you know what you are.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
Who killed Manzetti?
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
I may spill something.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
What's the surprise?
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
When?
We better have a drink first.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Thank you, handsome.
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
I don't understand.
Just get her drunk.
How 'bout the key?
Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
[Yes. Many times.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[The ransom was ten.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[Don't lie to me!]
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
That's your monkey, Denham.
Good luck, Captain.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
The men said, nine.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
That only leaves three.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
Can we come in?
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
You don't look so good.
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Hello?
Abu Kaleem Malik.
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
It's because of me.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
The 2-3.  Homicide.
A hot shot, huh?
Nah, just working the job.
I hear that.
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
He is dead?
Be good to her, my lord!
And--
Ew, look at this...
Gross!
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
???  
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
Then help her.
I am...
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
There's another choice.
What?
Aquittal.
How?
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
Why, yes.
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
Would they hurt her?
Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
Yes.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
All right, what do we know?
Let me lay a little theory on you--
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
No.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
Regardless, he still is your father.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
Will this do?
Where did you get that?
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
You don't like it?
And you told Mom today?
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Who the fuck are you?
Teddy. Your buddy.
Prove it.
I think so.
Remember him?
He was a bit proud as I recall.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
A dubious distinction, no?
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
Ow! That hurt!
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
What do you want, shithead?
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
Why don't you leave him alone?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
I know about what you mean!
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Beautiful all over, eh?
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
I think it's funny.
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
You're quick.
And a good thing too.
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
A football game?
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
But what about Major Houlihan?
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
Thanks for handling this.
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Thanks Walter.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Dude--
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Now Dude--
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
So what did you think?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
About a minute...?
A little longer for me.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
I want you inside me.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Oh, yes.
I'm sorry.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
You two could play checkers.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Danny?
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
On a passenger ship in 1953?
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
Do we have a gun in the car?
I remember you now.  Shit.
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
Oh, me -
How old did you say you were?
I didn't say.
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
I work at Seligman's.
Is that what you want to do?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
It's a long story.
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
Yeah.
The NSA killed him.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
What's going on?
They're here.
Who?
Them.
Where?
Here?
<u>Here</u>?!
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
Thomas.
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
How's the print coming?
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
Sometimes.
What about my father?
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
What'chu sayin'?
You framed-him...
We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.
But they both worked at the White House?
I will not talk about the other two.
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
What are we gonna do up there?
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
I know, but--
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
That's my point.
<u>What's</u> your point.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Why?
Because my life is being ruined.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Goodness, that's awkward.
What's up guys?
Hey, bud.
You've made it ... brighter.
I don't want you here, Terry.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
Two words.
Major.  Dish.
Nope. I was right.
Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
And they're changing into...
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What do you mean "complete"?
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
What in the hell...?
You are --?
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
Where's Hap?
He's dead -- good and dead.
Sorry to hear it.
He didn't suffer.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
Any friends?
No.
Ever see her with someone else?
No.
Did she ever mention any friends?
How exactly did you hear?
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
I like you.
Do you?
She's just no good.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
Good.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
It will?
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Hey, can I borrow this?
What? Why?
I promise I'll take good care of it.
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Hello?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
I don't get the distinction.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
I guess.
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
Well she...
She what?
She's a friend of Jill's.
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Great game.
Unbelievable.
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
No, Ben.
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
What the hell...
...Certain people are --
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
...Huh?
You know, on farm route 17.
Oh yes! In Muncie!
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
You don't say.
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
Every year?
Time out!
Time out!
Soprano or alto?
Hi.
Yes?
This your place?
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
Lori, move.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Poison emergency.
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Too deep to anchor out there.
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
You going to sit here all day?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
Just passing through.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
It'll cost you five bucks.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Not a one.
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
It was just a thought.
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
No.
No more revolts.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Well, I don't...
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
What's it to ya?
You must have a girlfriend.
That's none of your business.
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Hey the door was open.
Then get out and close it behind you.
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
I'll take the Mallory.
You want to go home?
I don't have one.
Please...help me...
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
Ride with me, cousin?
I could use the walk.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
That's if I want to see you.
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... 
But -- I was just lucky.
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Yeah.
Ray, we're just friend.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
We don't want to go there.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
He certainly could. About a month.
You're hurt --
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
What?
But they are not yet one of us.
A situation easily remedied.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
I need someone to translate for me.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
And I'm supposed to care?
Hey!  Give me that baby!
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Goddamn Sam!
He's insane!
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
And that's for the airport.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
John don't like him much.
Pearl dotes on him.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
There's something else.
What?
The money, Icey.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
Pike never confessed.
I said ten thousand.
You have blood on your pants.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
I won't allow it.
What?  Why...
Beth --
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
Beth.
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
Yes.
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
So you just want to use me and go?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Where is it! Please!
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
There!  Look!
...all the luck in the world.
You do?
17 years.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
I don't take those assignments.
What about Juno?
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Did you pork her Harry?
No.  But I wanted to.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
The answer is no.
Mr. Soze will be most -
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
Well?
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
Why?
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
Unwell?
I understand he was in a fight.
Has he been hurt?
What's wrong?
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
I got her arm.
Tunnel?
Uncle Terrence, you're...
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
Claude.
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Strange voices, Rose?
Yes, sir.
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Full power, sir.
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
It's too late...
It's NOT too late!
What were they saying? About you? In there?
They say I am no good to you.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Sal!... fourteen street.
Come on.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
My God.
God.
Remember that day?
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Thanks, honey.
We need experience.
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
You're fast.
That is our job.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
We have enemies.
The Chinese.
Yes.
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
No.
Do you know where she might be?
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Ready?
Nods.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
Move? Where to?
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
The third floor are low class rooms.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
I... I don't really know.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
What you got there, mate?
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
..or hard wired..
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
Who would do that?
Bob.
But Bob isn't real.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Maybe.
Natalya?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
You -- I don't know.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
You sell it.
To who?
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
Airsick?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
You're there now?
Oui.
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
No.
You're calling me on is phone?
Oui.
My number's going to show up on his bill!
Good night Angel...
Sure. I can follow that.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
The fax machines.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
It was a community service.
Where are they heading?
Inland.
Santa Rosa?
Oh nice save.
I was desperate. It was gross.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
He says he loves me.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
No!
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
I dropped you off after. You said --
Come up and see me... now.
It's very late.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
You're crazy --
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
Fine.  Fine.
So I can go.
Sure.  Looking good.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
Sir, we stay with the President.
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
I understand, but Annie, please...
- See, what you can do for him --...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
It isn't right to make him suffer...
You're smashed, Vanessa.
I am not.
Oh, yes you are.
Go!
Yeah.
What are you doin' in there?
Who's this?
She's in management....
I'm training to....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if  well I know I sometimes run on.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
Frances...
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Come on in.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
Like one?
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
Should we stop?
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
We're losing them.
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
What do you want from us?
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
What did he say?
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
Back to the ship, huh?
Get out of our way.
And to m...
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Energy shielding positive function.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
I don't want it anymore.
No?
No. It was an accident.
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
Right.
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
Yeah.
Plenty of pep, too.
Uh-huh.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
Christ! You do know it all!
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
You got the wrong man.
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
You killed him?
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
I'm sure you have
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
So how ...?
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
What has Tuttle done?
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
He's a freelance subversive?
I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
What's that?
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
I have.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
I'm all right.
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
I was in his cabin--
What!--are you crazy?
I'll explain later--
Bank branch!
Oh, man...
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
Plus a bonus.
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
The American? Yes, duck.
How did he look?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
Did I say something?
How do you know this?
We had a seance.
Who did?
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
How did you--
How are you today?
Okay, I guess.
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
What is he doing here?
It's the last place they'd look.
No-o-o!
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Good evening, Anna.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Aren't you late?
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
Tell me about it.
He was just doing his job.
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
Did you say, "I do"?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
What do you think of me?
What do you mean?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
What?
Did you know that?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Sit down, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
No.
What?
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Yeah. It's really good.
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
She was a liar, she was a liar!
This has to end.
End...?
It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
Is she gonna die?
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
Can we, can we go?
No!
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
I'd like a drink.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
What do you think?
Well.... er...
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
Whose fault was that?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
What guy?
So where do you know Alan from?
We play tennis at the club.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Yes.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
That's Babar.
Two bs?
One. B-a-b-a-r.
That's two.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
I don't know. I don't have any.
No children?
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
What?!
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
Passable, pimple, very passable.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Yes, Sire.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Who told you this, Majesty?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
I knew it. I told him.
Now what?
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
You're not a pain in the ass....
Yo' yellow, old man.
Jonathan?
Yes?
Any gas?
Gallon or two?
What have I done?
In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
You ask what the point is?
That's right.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
But not too ashamed.
Now you are being rude.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
Hold me, Don.
Don?. Where is he?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
The body?
Have you any money?
I have a little.
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
How did you know my name was Sarah?
You told me.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Okay. So what's your name today?
Yes? Who is there?
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Harry?  HARRY?!
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
I think I can handle that one.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?
No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
Hang...out?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
He had a yacht?
No, he just hung out there.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
What?
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we going to sleep?
Not here.  They might see it.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
How 'bout that furniture plant?
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
Yeah.
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
They done that too long in my family.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Are you sure?
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
Quite.
I don't have any sugar either.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
No.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
That was our apartment.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Why not mine the damned walls?
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
Yeah.  She told me.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
I heard.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
You?
For calling you a homo.
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
Seven.
And what do you see?
Somethin's in my room.
What is it?
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
We'll just get off at the next stop.
Say what?
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
The hell you talking about? What train?
It's freezing out.
You found us okay?
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
We haven't checked.
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
I guess so. Then what happened?
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
But there may be a few around somewhere.
What makes you think so?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Yes.
Huh. And why is that?
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Y'all mind the store.
Where are you going?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
Not very chatty.
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
Just ... uh ... you know.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
What was this one?
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Biggest in two battalions.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
It's probably not a good idea.
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
Hey!
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
That's good.
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
It's okay.
Mama let me help you.
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
Keep painting.  Promise me.
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
Yes.
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
Cool.
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
Yeah...
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Why did she say she was leaving?
She didn't.  She just left.
Why do you think she left you?
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
Oh no?
Oh no.
It's not what I heard.
About the other day...I've been thinking.
And the wine - excellent.
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
Who was that?
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Aren't you coming back with me?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
Thanks.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Knock-knock.
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
I cannot believe this.
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
May I ask why...?
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
Stressed.
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
It's always locked.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
He's dead, you know.
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Okay, cool.
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
I'll get it.
Damned clever if you ask me...
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
I do. I'm -- are you...?
I... I think I am...
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
The door was open.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Come on!
You the sentry?
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
And be poisoned out here in the open?
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
It's not what you think, Jake.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
Where are you staying while you're here?
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
And how long are you here for?
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
Oh. How old?
About a year and a half.
No, your kids.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
You're kidding.
Why?
The leads are assigned randomly...
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
Then put me on the board.
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
You people got a lotta nerve.
What you mean?
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
You been acrost?
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Caesar?  What is this?
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
Wait. Wait a minute.
What?
We can't do this.
We've already done this.
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
Wanna another beer?
Yeah.
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
What is it?
Why are you so interested?
Sorry.
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
That's great.
What?
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
What are you doing?
Just taking your photo.
I look terrible.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
Which part of no don't you understand?
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
Eleven to seven he blows it.
Twenty on my man...
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
Don't look like there's a right way.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
It ain't in me.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
I guess I'll rob a bank.
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
That sounds great!
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
What kind of school?
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
Hi, Richard.
What are you doing?
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
Like what?
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
What do you know about hypnosis?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
What if he's on the level?
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Tell everybody hey.
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
Really, Eve? Why?
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Why not?
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
I know how to get outside the shield.
Where do we come in?
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Possibly.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
That would be no.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
-- I'll get in the back --
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
-- there's not much room --
Lara called me.
What?
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
I'm fine.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
I go running down there.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
Vodka martini.
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Cognac?
I should be checking on the boat.
Someone missed you.
Is he the only one?
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
No
Would it be painful for you?
Excuse me. Excuse me!
You talking to me?
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
What'cha reading?
The Fountainhead.
Great book.
You've read The Fountainhead?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
Romantic? He rapes her.
That's a matter of opinion.
You need help.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
At this hour? I don't think so.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
Please.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
Who is that?
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
That's it.
Why didn't they say that before you started?
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
What are you going to be then?
How can I submit this?
Im sorry...
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Why, yes.
Where are you going?
I'm just leaving.
But where?
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Objection!
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
Newspapers?
No, the typing kind.
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
There are things you know for sure.
Such as?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
Your wife?
Richard - I saw a fin!
What!
Alice got married again.
She did?
You didn't even find that out?
There was so much going on.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
...And if I guess wrong?
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
We've still got to find the mainframe.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Get out of here!
What are my orders, sir?
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
This psycho can.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
But not for anything I did today...
Terrific.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
It's Miller time!
You buying?
Sure am.
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
The what?
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
Oh yeah.
Will? Are you awake?
No.
Come with me to California.
What?
I want you to come with me.
How do you know that?
I know. I just do.
Yeah, but how do you know?
I don't know. I just feel it.
And you're sure about that?
Yeah, I'm sure.
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
I can't go out to California.
Why not?
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
Then what are you afraid of?
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
What am I scared of?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
Is that what you think--
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
At least you have a mother.
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
What the fuck am I afraid of?!
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
I'm not honest?
What about your twelve brothers?
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
No, you don't want to hear that.
Yes, I do, Will.
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
Yes.
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
Both.
You didn't hear that?  "Take him... " Something.  "Bury him" or...
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
What gave me away?
You're sure this is gonna work?
Yes!
You're <u>sure</u>???
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
Ten days ago?
An Iraqi?
Kinda'.
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
What do you mean?
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
Meaning what?
You motherfuckin' Tino. You fucked us so bad.
Aye sir, coding now.
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Dissent?
You'll never guess what's happened!!
What??
John has fallen in love with me!
We're due to take off.
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
My name's Johnny Utah!
Who cares!
It seems fine.
There.
So shut up.
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
You wouldn't.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
What's that supposed to mean?
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He just tried to save him!
Who is this . . . Superman?
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
I know, by computers.
Hold out your hands.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
I just came to say goodbye.
Where are you going?
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
I think that's for the best.
Good for you.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
You really think so?
We've been attacked.
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
Looks like the natives are restless.
Guess I kind of lost it there.
You could say that.
You live like a pig.
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
All night.
Well... who are those guys?
What do they look like?...
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Well, what?
Godammit, George...
Now wait a minute...
Sit down.
But...
I'll do it, Jake.
No way....
It's my fault...I have to....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
Jake.
What time was it?
Huh?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
Tell me why...?
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
Then tell me.
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
....that's right.
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
I don't <u>think</u> so.
Then what brings you back?
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
...no...
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
...no...
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
...no.
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
Thank you.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Aye, sir.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Is he related to the witness?
You know it's a trap.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
I don't want to be a martyr.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
That's just a dream, William!
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
...Hello...?
I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around.
Tina, you are too slick.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Where's the ice cream?  The Hagen- Dazs butter pecan?
Shit!  I forgot.
Your memory is really getting bad.
Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
Born and bred.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Father, please don't die.
Morning.
You're up late.
Why are you doing this?
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
I don't understand what's going on.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
Yes, I know.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
So what?
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
She's got the most beautiful...s
Thanks for the help.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
It was exciting.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
It's alright, thank you.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
I beg your pardon?
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Do you feel that way now?
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Do you still feel suicidal?
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
Where are they?
Where is the play?
That was really great.
Was it okay?
Yeah!
What did you guys think?
Slides go with it.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
What?
Sure.
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
Well...
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
Get out of here!
Wait a minute, GordonI
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
All prop cars accounted for?
I'll have it tomorrow.
Is it morning yet?
What're you doing here, Roy?
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Yes.
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Quick -- hide in here...
What about you?
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
But where are you going to be?
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
Me.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
What are you going to do, Doc?
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Charming Schuvaloff.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Dark Valdez.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
And he doesn't care about me?
He is only curious to know who you are.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
He loves me, as I love you.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Now you're joking, right?
Perfectly absurd.
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
My God, you're shot...
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
There's no connection between the families.
There has to be.
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
Yes.  That follows.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
Could it be intelligent?
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
Are you a doctor, too?
Not yet.
Nigel, get lost.
I have to talk to you.
You're wasting your breath.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
Maybe...
Someone is after us, Pearl.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Why?
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
What?
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
Your family ate dripping?
No touch. No touch. No touch.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
Uh, <u>look</u>....
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
Oh? What?
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
Good. Anything else?
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
Albert.
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
A woman.
What color hair will she have?
Blonde.
Tell me some other things about her.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Mr. Thacker?
Yes?
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
If you wouldn't mind.
Where you been?
No, why?
'cause you stink of booze.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
It wasn't that serious...
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Let her go!
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
What do you do to him?
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
I do not know what you are referring to.
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
Is that what he told you?
Don't get out of the car.
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Do they know?
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
Who?
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
Now don't that call for an extra!
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
We'll grant that.
What!
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
I used to be married to one.
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Let it go.
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
What do you mean?
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
No kiddin'?
Almost certain.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
Don't worry about him...what have you got?
May I speak, sir?
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
You earned it.
I did not think so.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
I failed to resolve the situation.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Since right after we lost our son.
You mean after he lost your son.
It was nobody's fault.
But John was with him at the pool?
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
She's alright.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
What time is it?
Seven-thirty.
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin' take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros  away and you're a great big hunk of nothing  Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap connivinggood-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done you hear me? glad what I done!
You ratted on us, Terry.
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
I'll go up and take a look at the General - perhaps sit with him.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
Well 
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
C'mon let's...
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
Take me somewhere.
What?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
How about Italy?
Yes.
How about Bari?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Have you ever been to that station?
Yes.
Where is it coming from, Beth?
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
If you get it?
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Mmm.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
Your letter came yesterday.
It did?
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was wonderful.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
No, we don't have to say it.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
How can I look at you and say this?
Is that him?
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
Aren't you?
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
What?  But I saw 'em-
I'm not the maid!
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Beverly Center.
That's your father's diary, Ann.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
Did ya get the message, kid?
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
What a team.  See you at eight.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
I'll think about it.
You really will?
Can you put that in a bag or something?
You get it when I get her.
So like, yeahI caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviewsY'know, I figure I can always drop out.
So where'd you get in?
Prnceton.
But what did you get on your SATs?
Will you bring me a hanger?
What?
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
You're not at the center.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
And it worked?
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
Useless distractions.
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
And whom would you call?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Your cell is more than adequate.
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
What's wrong with my life?
I thought I'd find you here.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
That's the one about the albatross, right?
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
Fuck it!
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
I don't know.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Can I keep it?
It's no secret that you loved her.
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
I saw the longing in your eye --
-- that was lust --
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
Are you crazy?
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Five thirty.  Okay.
Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.
Got it.  Good tip.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
What?
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
You've been with Gray again.
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
No, no? You didn't?
I didn't give 'em the m-
Floppy, huh?
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
What cat  ?
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
I never heard about that.
You a woodcutter?
Farmer.
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
No...
What is it?
Something he said, just before...
He spoke to you?
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
Hey... you got stereo.
You saw the news today?
We seek to undo the curse.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Not yet.
I want to drive awhile.
I ain't tired yet.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
I loved you.
Is this your first time here?
Nobody escapes us.
I want to live.
No.
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
Not too quickly.
What?
You're a little too fast.
Can't you understand me?
I understand you perfectly.
Have you got it now?
Cotton Company --
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
The infirmary?...
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
Up!
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
That's not true.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
Are they any agent?
Yes.
Goddamnit!
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
Hurry, Suzette.
Can I take your coat?
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
The others?
Why can't you just tell me?
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
Yes.
To the foot doctor.
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
No, my lord.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
Yes, my lord.
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
Later.
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
Are you okay?
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
This'll work, huh?
Who is it?
It's me.
Who?
Me.
You wanted to see me?
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
... and what... what did he say?
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
Nowhere.
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
I don't blame him.
Hers.
Whose?
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Why did she call me?
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
I have your samples ready.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
That was a little joke.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Yes, sir.
Where are your men now?
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
Sir?
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
A private, sir?
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
But, sir...I...I...
Spit it out, Captain.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
What is it?
...Janitor's job.
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
I beg your pardon?
You should see the look on your face.
The fuck did you do that for?!
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
Which two?
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
Weapons storage...
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
It's your deal.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Who's Ivy?
What?
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Yes sir.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
No.
Someones after me.
Then we must call the police.
I will not have you use that name to me.
You up?
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Where'd you leave 'em?
I don't know.
Did you look around the headboard?
Jezzie, I can't see.
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Gee.  Thanks.
I snuck in.
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
Sorry about your window.
The James-Younger Gang.
Sorry.
What else did I miss...?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
...are they hard to get?
Impossible.
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
Think she means for us to follow?
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
I think you better leave.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
I'm not falling for it.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
How much?
You hear that?
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
No, sir.
Crabs?
No, sir.
Lice?
No, sir.
Through there for a bath.
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
Yeah.
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
How you doing on those shoes?
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
Kelly--
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
Backstabber?
No.
Liar?
Myra.
Shitbutt?
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
Oh, right.  Alright.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
So you'll stay?
Yeah.
What's the plan?
There are no more rooms.
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
I'd better go in.
I only live up there and across the roof.
Thanks anyway.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
What for?
I don't know.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
Where are you going?
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Look about last night --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
Stewart!
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
I'm sorry about that.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Ben Schwarz.
Schwarz. Jewish?
German.
How is she?
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
Could I have that in American?
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
I'm not afraid of her.
Why the hell not?
I don't know.  I'm just not.
Case... Are you alright?
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
I'll be okay.
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
You threatening me?
He's cracked up.
He is not cracking up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What did you ask me?
What?
What is the question you asked me?
I said, what have we done?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
Say it again.
What?
What you just said. Say it again.
I just want to get married.
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
You got this under control?
Yeah.
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
I don't know, Bob.  I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.
So?
So I don't know about horror.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
You owe me one, Virgil.
Who did he ask for?
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
This isn't right...
I'm not getting an answer.
This floor's freezing.
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
The ropes are coming loose.
Be careful!
I am--It's our only chance.
Nothing is worth your life.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
You do?
Yes I feel it in my bones.
You're talking nonsense.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
I should hope not.  I hate you!
That sudden?
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
But will it--hurt the baby?
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
I wasn't watching television.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
I thought it was interesting --
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Electra --
Her...
What is it, your charm?
This just won't work.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
What is it?
What d'you want?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
Do I need one?
Ah, a philosopher.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
No, tell me.
Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three...  It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?
Frightened.
Do you remember what just happened?
Yes.
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
I don't want to look pushy.
You won't look pushy.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
You won't come on too strong.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
I don't know.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
You know what to do.
No! No! Don't!
So, what now? Did those things leave?
Why don't you go check it out?
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
I'm just offering a place to stay.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
There must be a way to fix this.
Fix?
Wait.
What?
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
How's Mom?
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
I can help you out...
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Thank you.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
What do you mean?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
I see.
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
What business?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Well... I don't recollect.
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
You always stutter?
Why?
I'm not asking you to marry me.
No. What? No. I know.
It's more like a date.
It's a long way to go for a date.
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
What?
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
... What's the matter?
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
You're back.
It's Monday morning.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
I'm your family.
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
For what?
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
What choice?
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
Half.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
Well, here it's half.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
-- and why we need you.
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
That depends.  Where are we?
Do you think you're alone?
What?
Do you have a soul-mate?
Define that.
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
I know what you're like ..
How d'you know what I'm like?
Ross told me.
Really? What did he say?
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
He said that? What else did he say?
Just your age.
Which is what?
What? What?
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
What did you think?
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Stretch it out.
...how can you talk to me that... that...
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Don't you want answers?
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
About what?
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
What for?
His name?
Who?
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
I remember.
Do you remember what you said?
They're out of Glenlivet.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
My pleasure, sir.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Apology accepted.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Colonel will do.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
You told me Bourne was dead.
There was a mistake.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Will it track back to us?
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
And the Landy woman?
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
The clock's already ticking.
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
I see. He does talk loud.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
My dinner.
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Want one?
Well, come on!
Don't stop.
Stop what?
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
You don't look very happy to see me.
Should I be ?
Ed Concannon.
And then what happened?
I have no idea.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
And why is that?
Look pretty rough.
Arise and shine, young Hood.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
I have to admit there was a moment there when --
I see...
What a...jerk!
You got a back door to this place?
No.  What's wrong with the front?
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
No.
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
What the hell for?
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
Wait?
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
Oh.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
How many, would you say?
Lookit her bounce.
You're going to miss the train.
No, I'm not. 
What are your plans in New York?
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I love the symphony.
I made a fool of myself.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
What about the notes?
...So what do you think?
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
I know that, Dad, but --
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
He's got to help or it won't work.
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
I guess.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
Why do we always stay here?
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
I've never seen your place.
Exactly.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
They don't come over here that much.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
All right, all right. We'll go.
When?
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
You love him?
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
He tried to kill us.
What the hell's going on!?
Yes.
The Empire must have gotten here first.
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
What the hell are you doing?
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Why all the way to Del Rio?
So go dance.
With you.
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Where we going?
Quick drop. In and out.
Where's Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
How so?
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
That it?
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
What are you talking about?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
I didn't do that!
You said you were here all day?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
Excuse me.
Yes.
Can I have your autograph?
What's your name?
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
Just one question.  Please.
If you'll excuse me......
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Hello, Brigman.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
Sure.  No problem.
Well?
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
What did you think you were doing!
Are you with the tournament?
Uh huh.
Are you one of the players?
Yes.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
When I was very young.
It seems like such a complicated game.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Sounds very violent.
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
What a "drag."
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
What -- what's on your mind?
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
Are you ready to order?
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
That's right.
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
How?
Where will we go?
Hello.
Beautiful place...
Take it easy, Pop.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I take five hundred.
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
That's too bad.
What?
Are you ready to order here?
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Anything to drink?
Two Cokes.
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
You bastard --
Poor baby.
Bastard.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
Frank --
The bearer of bad news.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
No...
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
But you're only a mud carrier.
Good for you.
You don't understand.
Hey!  You there!
You want something, old man?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You want something?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
You can't do that yourself?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Christ no!
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
I said I was sorry.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
You're a good liar.
Almost as good as you.
Adam, that's not true!
Yes, it is.
Flight got you nervous?
There's a problem, Lamar.
Murdered?  Why?
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
What kinda twisted animal.
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
Whatta you mean...
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
What are you talking about?
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
I don't know...  What about the other women?
I'll warn them.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
Why?
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
"No, viejo.  That was Jos Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
Be sensible, Martins.
Who were you talking to?
Sixpack...
How is he?
Well... what happened?
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Second most common?
Skin cancer.
Eighty third most common.
Pitbull attacks.
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Mr. Zammito?
Uh huh.
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
How?
You don't suppose this is just part of...
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
But he also wrote --
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
What?
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
Then who goes?
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
What's going on here?
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
Certainly not.
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
The Cowboy??
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
Cynthia...what's going on?
It's been a very strange day.
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
You gotta be kidding?
Will you meet with him?
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
Let me hold him.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
You got a dog?
No, I have a cat.
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
How long can you stay?
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
They won't kill it....
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
You got two seconds!
You didn't have to choke me.
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Thanks.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
One day they'll find a cure.
Are you takin' the pictures?
...Yeah.
Is it hard to learn?
Who is that idiot?
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
Yes, I know.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
What? Assassinate somebody?
Billy!
This is Zero.
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
That's Brazil.
Yeah. Maybe.
No luck.
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
What changed?
I was with Max when he got the call.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
It's nothing.
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
I got to get home.
The name's Walter.
Ahh!  Ah!
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
You like it?
Oh yeah!
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
Folks come to Alaska for a real short list of reasons:  Money. Adventure.  Solitude.  Those cover most everyone.  But frontiers also draw another type of man.  One with a demon in his gut.  He comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest.
Yeah?
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
I was going to ask.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Would you say that again?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
I've never heard of it.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
Are you've seen it work cures?
So how come you don't have any kids?
You sure it's okay with you?
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
What is it?!!
What's with the cameras?
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
We need to get in there.
Are you the one who left that note?
I wouldn't know how.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
When he went to work, right.
What about yesterday?
Oh My God.
Daddy!
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
No way.
Lloyd.
I don't think so Boyd.
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
I don't want to know.
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
I can't beat a Triumph.
The town looks clear.
The bay doesn't.
How long have they been gathering there?
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
...yes I'm still on hold...
And what was this?
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
This is "Fly With Us?"
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
That's it.
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
When do I begin?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Does this look familiar to you?
This is it.
Let me see.
Dad...
Is my daddy okay?
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
I think so.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Okay.
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
What do you want me to do?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
He has lots of disks.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
You read me, Brewer?
Read you.
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
Like what?
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
Fuck you.
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
You're a good friend.
No.
What makes you so sure it was one?
I can't be sure.
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
They are much more than that, sir.
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
For killing a dolphin.
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Hmm.
Would you like a closer look?
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
You hear me?
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
What do you believe in then?
Good morning.
Good morning.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
I'm not here to bowl.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here  I made this for you.
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Say, Ni...
Ni...
...gger.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger.
'Fuck me hard!'
Fuck me hard!
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Again!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Again!!
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Nothing, man.
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
But I just got here --
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
Is he there?
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
John
I'll get the doctor.
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
What are you after?
Must one always be after something?
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
What?
Will you smile?
Why?
Just smile.
At what?
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
Why?
Because we are an odd couple.
Then you should go back to your table.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
What about the blood?
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
Have you ever done this before?
How'd it go?
Keys were in it ...
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Laura...
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
French?
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
There are more important things than tits.
Well how do we look?
Bonitas.
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
Hiya Carla.
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Gabe...your arm?
Yeah?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Francesca?
Yes! Hi.
Am I interrupting anything?
No. I was just... No.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
I would love to come for dinner.
Wonderful. Uh...
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
Oh, sure. Great.
I'll pick you up.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Okay. See you later.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clich about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
He wasn't acting?
Aren't you glad?
When?
Soon.
Next week? The week after?
I know what he says.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
What, do you think I planned it?
Did they have something against me?
Didn't they tell you?
I wanna hear it from you!
I'm sorry..
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
You think this is funny?
No.  I think it's ugly.
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
You heard from Reggie?
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
What did he find?
Nothing.
How good's your intelligence?
Very good.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
This isn't possible...
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
What... what are you saying?
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
If God exists?
I think now that he might...
Why?
Because I'm so horny.
God exists because you're horny.
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
Yeah, well...
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesnt suit you! Who knew Id found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands?
Youre mad...
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
Why... I dont know what youre talking about.
You know hed have had him killed, dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Have you finished?
What are you up to?
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
Stand by with the battering-rams...
We need another ten minutes...
How many...?
Will you leave me alone...?
You tagging them...?
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
The females have eggs....
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
Like who?
Just a thought --
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
He's . . . cold. . .
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
Good luck.
Hello, Sheriff.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Really? You think so?
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
I know.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
what I mean?
think that's, uh-
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
No, so help me.
it's my first time.
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
Yeah.
What did you tell that girl?
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Jesus...
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
It's not hopeless...
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
He was my Grandfather, too.
I meant biologically.
That's a crappy thing to say.
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
They'll meet you at the top.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
Are we hacking or asking?
Yes. In that order.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
Who?
...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
What's wrong?
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
What is it now?
Are you still looking for a job?
I guess.
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
Take your clothes.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off back to Essex!
Run!  Take off!
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
Goodbye, Mary.
Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
Al Capone!
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Michael...
Then the legs at the knees...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
Michael, I love you.
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
Yeah, can I help you?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
No students work for me.
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
Which one's your building?
I'm being punished.
Why?
I don't know.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
Why are you mad?
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
I'm sorry.
What are we doing?
Homework assignment.
What's he talking about?
Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
Thank Simone for the tickets.
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
Perfect.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
What?
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
Well, c'n we get him back home?
You mean you had a bad dream.
`Dave'?
Going to make a little stop back home, pick up my shirts, show him a little treat.
See y'at the Finish Line.
How is she?
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
Tell him about the toaster.
Read it.
Again?
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
Looks like a train ticket.
Hey, Sweden!!!
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
What are you talking about?
Don't sweet lip me.
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
I told you, he isn't here.
Out for the evening?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
Convulsion?
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
What do I say?
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
I volunteered.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Who is that young man?
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
So you saved her.
--be prepared.
We don't have time!
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
Will it?
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
A perfect moment?
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
No...
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
Thanks a lot, Craig.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
So you killed him?
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
Go!!!
That's Winston. He works here.
He's a big one. You two tight?
Yeah.
I am the great and powerful Oz...
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
It's been fired.
I'll go into town with you.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
Whats going on?
Im moving to Paris...it was right here...  Its a box marked Jack.  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Yes, Hannah?
But Roki said--
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
You can't.
Oh?
Oh my God...you're proposing?
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
Yeah.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Well, I never heard that one.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get <u>near</u> the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
What about newspapers and magazines?
Same thing?
So what do we do now?
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
Hey.
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Sore throat?
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
Need a ride?
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
Suck my cock!
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
Keep going.
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
What'll we do out there?
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
That's why the boltcutter.
What's that?
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
You don't count Saturday.
I'm not.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
What would have elapsed?
If we wait till Mon...
When did you write the check?
Yest...
What was yesterday?
Tuesday.
And when was that check cashed?
I don't know.
Prairie dog burrow...
Bullshit.							*
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
I don't look like no possum!
Saw that one.
What would you call it?
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
This is crazy.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
Yeah?
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
Who is it?
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
You smell like trouble --
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
You ok?
Were you Longe Range Recon --
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
You are?
Yes, I am.
What are you trying to tell me?
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
Why I don't...
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
Excuse me...
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
Hey Doug, where you been?
Teh... Tehronne?
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
Kay, I told you...
Goodbye, Michael.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
Michael.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Uh, Matthew...
Back off, George.
But I-- .
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
My father's house.
Well...flashlight?
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Don't bother
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
But I'm not prepared to die.
What about this morning? Any developments?
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
Yes. Why?
Yes, sir.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Yes sir.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
No, sir.
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
I thought you meant...
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
What else is ballast for?
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
You'll have to pack quickly.
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
A parka.
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
Stop!
Even now.
No...
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
Tell me.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
I don't know if I can with my leg.
What it might take is... doing time.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
Yeah.
Feeling better?
I just can't believe it.
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
What in the hell is it?!
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
...That's an old one.
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
You miss me?...
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
No, why?
I assumed because of the train.
It's okay.
Did you say cops?
Yeah.
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
Double-meaning intended, right?
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
Another woman?
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
You know who it was?
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
Promise me one thing.
Anything.
Hey, man, good to see you.
What difference does it make whether he			* was your guy or not?						    *
It makes all the difference.					 *
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
Yes, I will.
No, you won't.
Somehow, I'll know!
You won't remember!
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
She looks like a sick marrow!
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
What did the doctor say?
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
Then I can wear men's clothing.
That would hardly be proper.
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
And?
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
Ms. Kruczynski?
Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.
What are you talking about?
You sure?
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
Are you going down?
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
For emphasis?
Exactly.  It's the key.
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
What?
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Nick, she won't say why.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Is something wrong with Jane?
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
Can you see the other PIRs?
Cue music...
What music?
No.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
Would you like to come along?
We can't.
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
You don't think weapons are important?
See you later.
You really in trouble?
Stop.
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
I said no.
It's still an electric shock!
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
It's been a while.
Did we make it?
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
Like how?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Mild stroke?
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Up and around?  Soon?
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
Yes really.
Wow.  Thank you.
Once we have control again we - -
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
What's the matter?
I...I can't...
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Send that.
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Next month is June.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
June? That's my wife's name.
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
O.K.! Send that!
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Sure.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
The heart pumps it.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
The nerve centers -- the brain --
But what makes a thought start?
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
Where'd you find them?
What are you cooking?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
Wait! I need those!
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
You're not a big talker, are you?
That's right.
Is that a threat, Detective?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Barks a doleful farewell.
Fine piece of engineering.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
What's the matter?
It's that jerk Walter.
What happened?
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
You degenerate pig!
The bond is broken.
Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.
Yeah.
Drink.
What is this?
It looks like white's game.
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
You were. infantry right?
Yeah.
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
Morning, darling.
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
She wasn't in...you were al...
There's no witnesses...
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
Sounds like you know the job.
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
We're recruiting.
Who's recruiting?
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Yes, please.
Where do we go?
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
Don't mention it--
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
That's where she hanged herself.
Who?
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
What if someone finds out?
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
Yeah, whatever.
I mean it!
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
It surprises me.  It really does.
Get anything?
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
Sucks for you.
Who's your partner?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
Their weapons missing?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
I will finish what I've begun
She already has.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
What was that all about?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Sir, please lower your voice--
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
Can you love a fool?
You typed this report?
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
Did you hear me?!
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
Hey, peaches.
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
This is a waste of time.
We're focusing.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
Do you know about the chip?
What chip?
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Can we turn back?
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
That was lucky.
I thought you were a man of God.
Ask me when we get home.
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
Congratulations, Enzo.
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
What happened, Doolittle?
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
What's this?
Do I knock or something?
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
We're going to die, aren't we...
Agent Hadley.
Do you know who this is?
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
Ricky?  Where...what...
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
Thank ...you.
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Mother!
You're not going to Gray.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
From your lips, to God's ears.
You go first.
Ladies first.  I insist.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Yeah?
And I was wondering.
Yeah?
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
- and picked us up in the States -
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
Just do it.
We have a lot in common.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
Of course not.
You could help us.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Mr Lombard...
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
When did you get back?
How ya doin', Mookie?
No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
Why are you...don't stop...why?
What's that?
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
Just as you are, Sir...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
No.
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
I'm on the staff of...
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
No.  To the pain.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
I believe you.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
It's beautiful.
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
Dead?
Every ship but the four you sent.
Can you get it?
Your son, what did you name him?
Yeah, but --
But what?
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
Sounds good.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Talk to me about costs, here.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
What?  Right Here?
Mr. Millaney?
Yes?
"Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record.  Mayfield, Mother's name.  Air-mailing you photographs today.  Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina."  She bleached her hair, or course.  Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
But you still think she's innocent.
So... for how long do we have to...
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
Well, that's nice.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
Oh, no...
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
That's...
"...for my father."
I'm so sorry.
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Did you tell her?
What?  No.  No.
You didn't?
How did they get our phone number?
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
... Yes?
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
You didn't visit him in prison.
He didn't want me to.
Why not?
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He'd call every once in a while.
He called the day he escaped.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Did you know that when you married him?
Oh God.
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
I thought they came right past here 
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
No, I didn't.
Her name is Charlie.
Oh...
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
I'll do anything to help.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
What did you see, Chekov?
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
How you doin?
M'I gonna see you tonight?
That's right.
Then I'm doing fine.
What's new onna street?
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
She had beautiful hands.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
No, no! Just with her hands.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
Okay, be careful.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Who?
Twombley.
No shit.
You think Jack shot him?
Well, it was an accident.
Youre so...beautiful...
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
What for?
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
That's it?
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
You aced it, didn't you?
At least it's nothing contagious.
But do you agree with me?
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
How do we know what room she's in?
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
Nothing about the porters yet?
Porters?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
Roger.
What was that all about?
I can't believe you said that.
What did I say?
Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.
Where does he live.
Did you hear?
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
Hey!  You're not eatink.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Give it to me!!!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
Am I a suspect?
Jade, you're late.
Shut up a second...
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
And the rule was...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
Who... Who is that?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
I have 6 tons.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Elena!...But when...
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
Bonanza Jellybean?
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two...
I don't believe this.
The one on the left.
Damn! What are the odds?
What?
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
This is something.
Chuck, let's go.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
I'll try.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
When you get to Fiji?
You got it.
Slower! In... Out...
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
I don't think this is gold.
How long have you been awake?
And what did she die of, exactly?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Well, what about all your other friends?
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
I almost forgot....
Give me the page.
What are you talking about?
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
They're getting bigger.
What is with you?
Excuse me?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Well?
It looks....foreign.
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.  For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
No.
And where are the Expedition Maps?
In my room.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
What's the matter with you?
How is this, sir?
Perfect! Perfect!
I wish you luck, sir.
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
What did they say?
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Good.
The what?
We know so little about each other --
We know all that we need to know --
But there's so much to tell you --
Don't.  That will come later.
Will it?
We'll try.
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
Probably because we've never met.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
I haven't seen you around here before.
Home school. Til today.
Home school? What's that?
I go to school where I live.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
His what?
His . . . whatever.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
Yes.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
You can believe that if you want to.
What's T-J?
Tijuana.
They were here?
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
He deals in pain.
Is this where no one stays?
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Don't be smart.
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
No.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
What is it?
The wound is bleeding!
Hmmm...
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
She never particularly cared for me.
She didn't love you?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
She held that against you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
Dream on!
Jesus fucking Christ.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
People liked him.
Most people did, yeah.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
No game.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Shelly?
Miss her?
Yes.
Sorry?
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
This is what we do?
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Are you on drugs?
Kelly--
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Part of our research--
I'm not even a field person.
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
Vincent?
Yes, Max?
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
Ouch!
Far enough.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
More.
See that scrub oak yonder?
Fuck you.
He's blind, for Chri...
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
HERE THEY COME!
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
Close enough to walk to!
What?
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
What next!
What color hair does he have?
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Right. The blond guy.
OK. That's wrong.
Dignan, it's --
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
I'm off.
Wish you weren't.
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
Why would he pick this one?
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Not that I know.
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
The jockey!
But I...
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
What's wrong?
Gibarian.  He was here.
You said he was dead.
Time from my mark...
Two minutes, ten seconds.
You don't trust me.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
In radio we're different.
I might have an idea...
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
What is your position?
Second musketeer.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
You seem to understand a great deal.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
Equals?
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
Me?
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
I don't want to.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
Blow me.
What did you say?
You okay...?
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
You?
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
I do.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
Shes pretty... See you, huh?
So, is everything okay?
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
Fine.  Be that way.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
No.
A murder.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
What do you want from me?
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
I don't know what to say.
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
You won't say anything to my parents?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
We sometimes went downtown to score.
What?
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
You just - Just stop him.
Oh, shit.
Someone pop your balloon?
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
Oh, sure.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Oh, wow.
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
But what about that math project?
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
Forget I asked.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
Now, just a minute --
Ever seen one of these before?
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
I see you go to the night court.
I've made the scene.
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
Don't you see...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
This is your ship?
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
El Capitan?
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
Can I have another one?
Okay, one drink.
What do you want?
A beer?
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
It's stopped.
What?
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
Why did you do that?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
This is not cool.
It was cool last night.
I have to go.
Are you telling me no?
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
Whiskey!
You can't come in here.
What dya mean?
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
You think this is all a joke?
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
Now Im worried...just say it.  Whatever it is well deal with it.
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
Well, not exactly.
For a while.
You're gonna let us go?
I need a cigarette.
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Instead of going into his mind...
We can't touch Hoover --
I thought the gloves were off.
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
You should always look to the back too, kid.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
Get on with it then.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
And you were gonna pay me back?
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
Yes.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Did you see Jack?
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
I really don't know.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
I pick that way.
No!  It will cave in!
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was fine the way it was--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
--mine's better--
--no way--
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman...
Call me Charlie.
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
So have dinner with me tonight.
I can't.
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
Somebody already did.
What?
You didn't hear?
Hear what?
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Did the police contact you?
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
What does she do for you?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Beaumont worked for you.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Was she?
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
...Why?
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
But he was such a good cop.
They always are.
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
Spanish kinda guys!
Don't you ever get bored around here?
What do I have to do?
Some tap dancing, some singing.
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
I really gotta get going.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Yeah. Maybe.
Goodnight.
I thought I knew everything about him.
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
Never again, never again...
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Arrrgh!
It wasn't him.
Who was it?
Me.
Who?
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
Honey, what happened?
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
What about me?
You're different.
I am?
You're great.
I am?
Yeah.
Do you really mean that?
I came on a bus.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
Who's "Eleanor?"
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
Then why are you so upset?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
Better late than never, right?
Hmm.
"Hmm" what?
What do we got?
What are you doing?
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
Uh-uh-why?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Still nothing from the colony?
What's that?
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
What were you fighting for?
Don't remind me.
What happened here?
How much more?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
You have other information?
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Did he get you the job?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
To freedom.
Tick-tock...
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Your mess.
Then shut up.
Is it something you've heard about me?
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
I...have a request.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
What happened? What did they do to her?
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
You?!
Me!
You're in league with Barbossa!
We spent it!
Ha. Ha.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
Tell me about it.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Constantly sick.
Not just every six weeks.
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
Get over there!
What's the matter?
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Can we phone them in, Paul?
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
58th and Central.  You know it?
South Central.
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
I have so got brains.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Then light the match, Paul.
No big deal.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
I want you to help my little girl.
I'm only a student.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
Mrphmmmph!!!
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
I'd better get in there.
That's a lot of people all at once.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
No news is not good news. Y'know
There was a recipe on the back  --
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
You're a window rattler, son.
I didn't mean to get personal.
Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
Where's your chief supply officer?
Beverly Hills --
What?
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
I like it better when I'm on top.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I'm a little worried, James.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Hallo, Peter.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
Oh my God! We're dead!
Clarissa left those here.
I won't tell mom if you don't.
When did you start smoking?
I've seen him.
You have?
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
Look how far we've come.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
My gun?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
I need it.
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
Are you out of your mind...?
...I'm going to need your help...
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
I'm going to help her.
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
Now what?
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
It is insane.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
Do they know?
Know what, honey?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
Uh...home...
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
Anything... anything missing or different.
I don't see anything.
Are you absolutely certain?
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
... What do we do?
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
--there's nothing new in it--
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
I I'd like to, Edie, but  there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
You haven't finished your beer.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Who came in after you?
Thank you.
How did you know?
Know what?
That there was a gun pointed at me.
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Fine.  I'll say no.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Fine.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
No, I have to work.
How un-sixties of you.
I was nine in the sixties.
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
Helping people makes me happy.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
Why?
Waterford, Vermont.
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
I will.
Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
We be honored, friend Ogg.
Those blue things ate everybody here?
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
What? By myself?
Where was that, Florence, huh?
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
You're welcome, John.
Looks quiet, y'know.
I think it's closed.
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
Lori...
Yeah, sweetheart?
Let's do it.
Do what?
How about music?  You like classical?
Better times.
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
I always liked ya so much...
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Oh, right.
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
No, you're his wife.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
It don't look right.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
And you're drinking with them right now.
Why didn't you tell me?
There wasn't any way to explain it.
Yeah.
You sent me to him.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
Who's she?
She's on TV.
If you don't start telling the truth... 
What do we do?
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
What's the matter?...Grace?
Nothing.
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
What scars?
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
If he files are you going to take the case?
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
What's she like?
Detectives, what is this about?
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
Me?
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
I care for her.
You won't even try?
Where are you going?
Just out for a while.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Oh, come on Dad...
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
He's pretty young for that job.
Well, no younger than I was.
Maybe you were born older, George.
How's that?
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things . . . design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
Into the Hudson?
We're sure it's hers?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
I don't want you talking to Jerry.
Well, I don't know. That depends.
On what?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Like what?
Love ya.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Where?  Maybe we can.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Aramis, this will never --
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
But --
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
They grow outside, don't they?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
You going to take me on a nature walk?
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
I didn't mean --
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
Well, yeah, but --
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Now by killer, you mean...?
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.
What's this?
But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
Walter, I'm sorry...
Get it.
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
You mean Delaware?
No. New York.
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
No ...
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Well, if that's possible ...
It's possible. Just negotiate.
A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes.
You read about it, I'm sure.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
I thought you would have some ideas.
Why should I tell you?
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
Pray tell.
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantage?
You're insane.
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
You peeked, didn't you?
[Reality very risky.]
You won't find a better place!
Are you sure he's still lives here?
Can I take off my clothes now?
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Do you really want me to?
Yes I do.
We're going to lose.
You can't know that for sure.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
Who?
Mrs Brown.
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
What's her excuse this time?
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
Do you really think so?
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
Owens!
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
What did you do that for?
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
Virginia...?
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
Do you have any weapons?
The best. But we won't need them.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Sorry about that... I just...
You go north, I'll go south.
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
But... how is he going to breathe?
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
That was D'Agosta.
The planetarium!
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
Are you in charge, Roper?
Yep.
Will you mind your own business!
Nine bodies.
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
...delusions and paranoia.
I was all of these.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
What about Oleg?
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
No, he is here.  Shit...
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What's your cut?  How much?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
No.  No way.
But it's...
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
What else do you need?
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
What do I do?
What do you do?
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
What are you doing here?
Nice, huh?
Beautiful.
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
Miles.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
She what?  When?
About a month ago. Six weeks.
"Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
How'd you know where I was?
Nathan told my brother.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
I'll take a bus.
I'll take you... why not?
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
Alex, please-
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
Where' you goin'?
Out.
Want me to come?
No thanks.
My advice to you?  Don't die.
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
I know.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
What about him?
Eddie? ...
Yeah?
Are the TV people with you?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Send him away.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No.
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
No. It's a mess.
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
Where'd you hear that?
Around.
You almost went over your limit.
Why didn't you tell me?
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
It's him!
You here again?
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
I don't really like your friends either.
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
You were attracted to me?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Wait, I was going to tell you--
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
But now you don't have to--
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
At my house...!
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
I don't know.
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
I know you've been trying to kill me.
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
So now you know.
So it's time to go home.
That's all I get?
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
I don't think so.
We have to go home, Jason.
Jason Bourne is dead.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Keep it. 
Jason...  They can't let you go...
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Nope.
See?
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Excuse me.
What?
Our cards, please.
What cards?
You have our cards.
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
How much?
But that isn't possible.
Blood oath.
No mother.
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
Show me something?
Like what?
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
Tell me. What do the police say?
They're calling it an accident.
Who's the investigating officer?
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
Do you know him?
Oh yes.
Where from?
We worked in Chinatown together.
Would you call him a capable man?
Very.
Honest?
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
None.
That's too bad.
Too bad?
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
What are you suggesting?
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
I didn't mean for you to go!
This way, Daphne.
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
Maybe you're happy.
Jason.. Can you hear me?
There is no going back.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
Good job.
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
You must have some money.
Just a few bucks.
And Myra's stuff?
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
At what?
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
What?
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
I know you do, so that's why --
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
Why are you mad at each other?
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Uh huh.
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Did Daddy tease you?
How's Mama and the kids?
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Just sandwiches...
Got it?
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
Yeah you did...
Right... You have a boat.
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
The "come back" kind.
How do you know that?
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Did you?
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
You don't know.  You don't....
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
Red Rum.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Red Rum.
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
We could have lunch together.
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
How do you know so much?
None of your business.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
I'm telling you, I was there.
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
It wasn't a trick!
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
You're just jealous.
Jealous? Of what?
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
Please, have a seat.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
What is this?
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
Oh, no.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Really?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
Will I go crazy or something?
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Excuse me?
Come over around seven.
O'clock?
Yeah...
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
I rode here, on my horse.
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Yes?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
You hate your father.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
You'd hate him for the trick.
I feel sick.
Listen to this --
Not now, Jonah --
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
Jonah, I'm leaving --
What are you doing in here?
They won't --
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
You!  I remember you!
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Leave.  Now.
Can I say something in my defense?
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
What are you talking about?
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
Uh huh.
Very well, let us move on to...
Prisoner exchange.
Sir?
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Shut up!
More champagne, your majesty?
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
Frank!
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
Alexander Pope?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
It's no big deal.
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
How do you know?
Mr Brown.
Ma'am.
You are here safely.
Aye, ma'am.
You are well?
I am.
And the pony?
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
It's the big potato.
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
For the same reason you did, to help.
Hello?
Are you still coming?
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
I can't hear you.
Waited too long, hon...?  
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Why don't you answer?
I know I won't be your puppet.
You can go now.
Where are you going?
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
Aren't you going out today?
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
I have the stuff from last year's...
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
It means, "Never without my permission".
I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
You're a lucky man, Diego.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
It's coming.  Hold her down.
What's that, Frank?
Three legs.
That's too many.
Backup?
What about me?
Perhaps.
To see your father?
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
What do you want me to say?
You said this ship creates a gateway...
Yes...
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
I don't know...
Where has it been for the past seven years?
I don't know...
The "Other Place," what is that...?
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
Adrian.
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
But if he knew we have so little time -
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
What would it take?
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
You seem mighty collected about this.
What is this, Rogoff?
Where's everybody?
They gone to the field...
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
Are there any special instructions?
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
If you say so.
Did I ever tell you about how...
... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
I have this effect on lots of women.
I bet you do.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
Alan's in Utah.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
You are a rich woman.
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
Is that right?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
I never promised you anything.
How could you let her see this?
Goodbye, Bobby.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
I already have.  Come on.
Ms. Thompson.
Call me Nancy.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
Claudia, let's get married?
What! Get married?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
That's why I asked you...
Yes...?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
I had a teacher like that once.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
As for instance?
Well....
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Are you hungry?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
At-at-at-at-at.
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
But where did they get those people?
Everybody okay?
We're all here.
They made me put my hat back on.
I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
They pressurize us with helium.
What's wrong with oxygen?
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
Are you?
What about Bill?
What about Bill?
He's in love with you.
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Why should he - and why should you?
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
Enjoy the day.
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
Don't lie to me.
All right, so I made another deal.
Don't you have anywhere to go?
So.  Hopeful.
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
Here?
Yes, sir, he --
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Are you angry with me?
No!
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
I didn't say that.
Are you in love with someone else?
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
Yellow pages?
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Wow!
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Yeah, sure, I guess...
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
You're done.  End of story.
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
Some agent you are.
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
There you are!  Man, I don't know how to thank...
Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
I'm not giving up.
Did I miss something?
What are they looking at?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Nonsense.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
You don't have to...
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
How are you doing.
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
Mistake?
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
Go for it.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
All the failures, all the fatalism.
Washed away.
And I might have something important to tell you...
What is it, a surprise?
Yeah?
Everything okay?
What's the matter, hon?
So what do you want?
Well?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
That's me, Sir.
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
They sound like you.
Fuck this, let's get something to eat...
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
Where is the child?
He's in his room, playing.
Where are you going?
I'm going out!
You're not going anywhere!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
Hello, young fellow.
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
There's only four of them...
No, it isn't. I'm hungry andand scared.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
This is your money?
Ali?  What's wrong?
They were all over the place.
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
I don't want to hear that music right now.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I don't.
This one has a special meaning.
Stop that!
Pay no attention to me.
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
No! Not the camera guy!
Why, Craig. why?
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
How did she die?  I wanna know.
You don't wanna know.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
Trilithium?
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
And carrying.  The National Flower of Albania, something..... Now Is it some Festival?  Some <u>Harvest</u> Festival, something...
Get on this, right now...
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
...this's <u>good</u>...
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
What do you want to break?
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Why?
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
I know what a "witness" is.
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
He was doing a great job.
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Oh, leave me alone.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
You borrowed money from your mother?
Yes!
Well, don't do that again!
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Don't be stupid.
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
We have matching luggage.
Where to, madame?
Can you recommend a restaurant?
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
Where do you eat?
At Pre Mathieu's.
Where is that?
It's just a place for workmen.
Where is it?
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
There'll be other chances.
You two make quite a couple.
We're supposed to.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
Suspicious, after all these years?
I miss you.
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
That's a different dress.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
I'd just be guessing.
Guess!
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
I do not love him.
That's my boyfriend.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Hm.  Is it?
Give it up, Evelda.
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
Give it up.
Okay.
What is it?
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
You two been busy in here.
What happened to Adele?
No, I didn't you did ...
Well, what happened?
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
Wait, don't hang up.
Okay?
What are you doing?
Are you playing a trick on me?
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
Movement!
Position?
Can't lock up...
Talk to me, Hudson.
I can't do it.
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
There's worse places.
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
Yeah.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Yeah.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
One thing bothered me.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
You enjoy it?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Tell me what happened.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Nobody saw you bring her in?
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
What did you do with her body?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Well, you know.  It's um...
So you think I should?
What?
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Like songs?
Yeah, they could be songs.
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Now?
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Stupid tart.
She left a note.
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
What do you mean?
Is the baby okay?
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
Sorry about that...
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
Hello, Bill.
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
...of the West.
My partner...
Morning.
Morning.
You people looking for work?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Can you pick peaches?
We can pick anything.
I hate outside! I hate it!
This.  Right now.
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
It wes a dream...!
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Stop it!
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
Since when?
What time's he coming home?
Break's over.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
Did you know him very well?
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
And you admired him?
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
You knew him best.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
Yes, I know...
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
Both of us...
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Were you with him, when...
Been a long time, huh...?
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Where are you going?
You.
All the answers are numbers.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
What do maniacs always want?
Recognition, of course.
I'm your program?
Right on the money!
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Hmm?  See them?
May we look at them now?
Mike's out there.
What is it?
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
I'm sorry.
Here come six more... grid two!
It's like...you've turned on.
T-turned on?
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.
Like what?
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
So I hear. Is that all?
Any news?
I don't want you to let go.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
I forgave you the moment you said it.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
This chink have a name?
We come watch... we come watch...
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Fire moat... why do that?
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
Dude, prom sucks.
--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check.
...check...?
The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
...you're definitely doing a story...?
Yes, sir.
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
...So, uh, who should I--
You know how to get there?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
It's you...Irena...my friend!
Don't cry, Amy.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Damn...
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
I'm sorry...
What are you doing here?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Are you nuts or something?
It's just business.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
What's this movie you're doing first?
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
What?
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
Yes, but...
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
Uh-huh.
Well, let's check it out.
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
It makes you nervous?
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
Would you really have drawn my blood?
Popcorn?
No thanks.
Piss off, Dave!
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
I wanna know...
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Thanks, I needed that.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
A -- a tourist.
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
Frances, I'm warning you...
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
In due time.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Very funny...
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
Huh?
He's trying to form words.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
What?
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
That's not it.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
You don't understand! It's her father...
Mr. Rose *knows*?
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
I thought you were...
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
What happened to Cole?
He retired.
Where?
Upstate.
Upstate where?
Atascadero.
Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
Someone's following me.
What?  Who?
Where are the others?
Who? Me?
How are you today?
Things seem to be getting better.
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
At least it finally stopped raining.
Thanks.  Let's go
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Why?
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
Did they hurtcha?
Put down Lex Luthor !
Good night.
Good morning.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
So that's it.
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
We should talk alone.
I can't. I need my family around me now.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
You're the coward.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
Neither do I.
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
That's the only way to the Monolith...
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
I see.
I see.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Who was that?
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
How?
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
Why would they care what we think?
Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
But you have no proof.
No, Miss Ratched...
And yet you suspect her.
Yes, that is correct.
Why?
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No, not really.
Interesting.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
That thunder's sure somethin'.
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
Where'd you get this?
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
Who's the nut?
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
Interesting.
Nothing comes.
Most interesting.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
Why?
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
I don't know.
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
Hey, look--
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Whatcha got there?
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Well, let me have it.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
Life signs?
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
It's your favourite...
Who are you?
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
Marie's dead Mama.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
Who are you?
...You mean it?
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
Could he have been at all conscious?
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
Jesus!
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
Every guy has a type!
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
What do you mean?
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
Oh goodness, no.
Then why are you here, Joe?
I came to see you.
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
Very well, I'll watch.
Watch me do what?
Whatever you do.
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
And I'll be a visitor.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
Are you trying to be funny?
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
Father, that's enough now
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
Such as?
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
Do I know who lives down there?
You can find out.
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
Pretty big chance, huh?
Yes.
Have you ever tried to develop it?
I don't know what you're asking?
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Sort a few things out.
Been busy, have you.
How d'you mean?
It's been a while.
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
That's not what I heard.
What was that, then?
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
No.
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
You don't have to say anything
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Please, there's no... Oh.
I wasn't saying anything.
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
Don't fight.
This ain't workin' right!
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
How did it happen?
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
Where's Clark?
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
I don't see my container.
You try anything, it goes in...
...the river.
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...
...-tainer!
Where's Arlo?
It's on...
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
You'd be surprised.
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
Mph rmph rm!!
No you can't Kenny!
Mph rm rmph!!
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
Surprised?
Surprised!
Love me?
I'd rather be with you.
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
And you like them?
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
Just someone so young...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I... I don't think so.
Does that mean you don't like me?
No, of course not.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In what way do you mean?
In whatever way you think I mean.
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
...What do you mean?
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
I came to see Merle.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
Yeah.
You are his friend.
Where is he???
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
And ask him about his private life.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
Don't call me stupid.
No.
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Red or white?
Where are you going???
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
And you're in love overnight?
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Lee...
Indy? Did you talk to them?
Yes.
So now they believe me.
Forward motion, Captain...!
What are you doing?
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
Kids.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
What happened?
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Jesus!
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
I guess.
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
That's right, Modern Times.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
Yes. 
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
What's that to miss?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
Does Chicago count?
You lived in Chicago?
When I was first married.
Yes.
What?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Why?
I don't know.
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
I don't know what you're talking about.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
Go to hell!
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
How many times have you been on an airplane?
I think maybe over a hundred.
That's right you travel so much.
Oh, no.
... what?...
That headboard.
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
What?
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
I know.  But chances are...
Nuke--  Good luck.
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
That's pretty bad.
The most wonderful thing happened -
What?
Guess!
What happened?
You're not going anywhere.
I just wait. You know?
Huh?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
So do I.
You do?
Oh, now, that's a great one!
You like it?
Bravo!
It's not unthinkable.
What?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
Can't you see it?
No.
It's there.
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
Has he?
Who are you?
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Yes!
Are these the articles?
Yes!
Were you present when all these things took place?
Yes!
Are they true!
NO!!
But they did take place?
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
And you saw them happen?
Yes, but I
That's all, Miss Bennett.
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
You don't know the real me.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION

Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
Sam!
Jack!
Long time no see!
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
You sound worried.
I mean they want to get caught.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.

Look out.
What'd you come back for?!
Why'd you stay behind?!



My God. He's going after the nest.
Yes sir, I saw it. 
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
I am all attention.
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
A little...
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
know, but
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
I don't hate women.
You hate women.
False.
True.
Not true.
You have a King fantasy.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
And what happens when you can't?
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
You're a fool, Babe.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Good night, Oliver.
That sounds good.
I've been working double shifts.
Extra money, huh?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
Courage, Jack.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
Stand...?
Retire.
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
Yes?
David. Please.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
I plan to. Soon.
How soon?
This spring.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Yes.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Oh.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Sixpack?
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
How about a Big Mac?
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
No.
What do you want, then?
Nothing.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
No, I didnt...thats great.
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
Uh huh...
[How does it work?]
And how would we neutralize him?
They perk me right up.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
What is it?
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Where?
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
Did they try and fail?
Doesn't that please you?
Very much.
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
I'd rather read, thank-you.
What is it?
Now that's a lock.
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
I'm worried.
Me too.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Easy enough.
Yeah, I'll go.
Are you all right?
I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
I'm coming.
Ms. Burton. You're black.
Is that a question?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Where where...
Dick, don't...
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
You don't understand this guy.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
I'm not running.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
Any demands yet?
At this point we don't have much.
How much they want?
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
This is hardly the time or the place.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
So that's what we almost died for?
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
How?
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
<u>WHAT</u>?
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
Gus?
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
What if I say no?
...I've missed you.						*
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
All right. Be careful.
You fucked with me for the last time!
You're sure there's more where this came from?
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
That's what it looks like!
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
Where are you off to?
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
Remind me why.
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
So?
What are you staring at?
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
Half don't...Bring her about....
I am...You must know something about him....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
This is --
Hey, what's happened to you?
Nothing. Why?
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
No.
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Who's that?
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
What are you lookin' at?
Nothing.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
Well do you think it was him?
What do you think?
Can't you get him?
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
He never told me.
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
You okay?
Where's Craig?
She going to be all right, Doc?
How many pills were in that bottle?
You ready to keep winning?
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
You want me to wait?
Yes.
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
What do you know about this place?
What's happened?
It's a fucking shame.
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
I'll get some.
You've said that for weeks.
I know.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
Chris!
All right.  All right.
I couldn't go near that woman.
Don't!
It's a fire fight.
Of course.
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
Are you trying to panic the women?
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
Not yet.
You think they're still up there?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
Can we go home soon Rachel?
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
You think they'll be alright?
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
I could fight you on this.
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
You don't call.
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
Right.
So I don't call either way.
Right.
So what's the difference?
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
Right.
Well that sucks.
It sucks.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
Unless she comes back first.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
There's the rub.
There's the rub.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
Hey man, don't sweat it.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
No problem.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
Does this room look silly?
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
Company's not here, is it?
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
Maybe.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Since when have things been normal?
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
Nope.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
Hey! -
Just one.  The bar's closed.
The one time I want it to work...
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
I've literally got to run!
...Dave?
Ed... you're kinky!
The phone made me do it!
You've been having strange sex...!
No, Brett, I...
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
Ilsa, I --
-- Yes?
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
Jani! Where are you?
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
How are you?
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Did you solve your problems?
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
You didn't get ketchup?
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
Put this on!
Do you know my first name?
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
I met a man with sharp nails.
Scobie?
I left him hanging around the American Express.
I don't gamble.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
She's down.  Help her...
What are you doin'?
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Lemme have the bag.
Yeeeess!!!
They're takin' off.
Huh?
They're movin'.
Right!
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
Eight.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Goodbye.
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
Then we're screwed.
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
I finished all the interviews.
Let me see the files.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she?
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
Do you recognize this young man?
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
...-lem?
You find yourself wearing a...
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
...you answer mine.
Got that?
So you don't remember...
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...seriously.
You women are crazy!
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
Then why you doin' it?
How long will he need to be asleep?
That was good.
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
Ok.
I don't freak out very often.
What do you mean?
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
...I don't know what you mean....
I don't freak out.
Ok.
Have a good trip.
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
- Instant melt-down.
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
Well, then ask him his name!
I wouldn't.
I'm fine, thank you.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
Well.  At wakes.
This is a little different.
How much you playin' for?
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
Who?
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
Gee.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
Why?
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
Honest?
Will you let me ask you some questions?
It's warm.
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
There a problem, Foley?
I can't see it.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Thank-you.  The real world.
Where is Rae?
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
What happened?
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
Who?
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
You own this land.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
What about the law?
No more counting the big money for someone else.
Now just a moment, just a moment --
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Just what are you saying?
You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
Sure.
Uh, look, Diz...
Guess you gotta go.
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
Basically...
He's mooing.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
I am relaxing.
This is not relaxing.
Really?
Really.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
If you want me to.
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  Bury him all over the place.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
Really?
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
I can get you a job.
A job?
Yes, the money is good.
As a plumber?!
It's easy to learn.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
We started over, you can too.
Yes.
Well?
Should I wear it?
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
Get out.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
You know Vinovich?
Sure.  Vivovich.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
For what?
For an introduction.
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
Just as you say, Doctor.
Thank you, Major. 
Good day, Doctor.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
Thank you.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
Yes, I know.
I have to go.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
Excuse me. Yeah...
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Murdered him?
My heart stays here.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
To show that we're negotiating.
All right ... send them the guard.
Fill her up?
My God, we're back where we started.
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
I like this case.
Really?  It makes me sick.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
You didn't care about my case?
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
Thanks. Have a good one.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
Superheroes.
Should I kill them?
What did you do?
I put her to sleep.
H... how?
It's dead.
There.
I beg your pardon?
There wolf!  There castle!
Why are you talking like that?
I thought you wanted to.
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
He was our teacher... He was great.
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
An Austrian.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Fiction or non-fiction?
Why don't you shut up!
Well!
Are you going to listen?
Go on.
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
What do you mean?
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
You mean, you're a thief?
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
I don't believe it.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
LET THY SPIRIT
You know what we're saying!
LET THY SPIRIT
Checking the locks again?
No, I'm not afraid.
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Yes...?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Would you recognize him again?
Yes.  I think so.
Oh, no...
What?
Didn't bite.
What?
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
I thought you were buying my company.
I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
I'm a businessman, kid.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Fifty per cent?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Aaaahhhh!
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
Hey-
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
You're not going, are you?
Yeah.
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
Keys.
What?
What about my keys?
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
How different?
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
Are you all right, Marty?
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
You don't look angry.
How do I look?
Is it too late?
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
Don Tommassino.
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
I know.
Where are you going?
Corleone.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Of course. I forgot.
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
Found it.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Why not?
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Oh please.  Another one.
What would you like?
Something pretty.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
How did you?...
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
In here, Mom...
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
Nikita?
So how long will you be in England?
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You must have a visa or something...
You're asking for my documents?
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
GET MAD!
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
Just the missiles.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Speed?
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Call them every five miles.
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
You're exaggerating!
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
Is that a fact?  He's a dilly, ain't he?  By the by, what did he have against this boy?
He goes out with girls.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
I don't like coffee.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. Its all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youre not walking away!
Oh, cut the crap!
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
...What do you do?
I'm retired.
What did you do?
I'm a welder.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
Cast iron?
Yes.
I don't mean braze.
I didn't say braze.
Pot metal?
What did I say?
Were you in Nam?
Yeah. I was in Nam.
So was I.
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
George? Was he alone?
I don't think so.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
Brady!
Get up there Rachel!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Are you crazy, Ray?
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
I need you.
Why?
You sure?
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
No one would miss me.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
He's a DOCTOR!
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
Get back in there.
My son is out there!
Brought it.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
Thanks.
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
Now who are we talking about?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Do you think we can turn it on?
Well?
Mother . . .
What?
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
I had to tell 'em something.
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
Thanks for your help, Peck.
Are you okay?
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
Luck.
That's an excellent idea.
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
No, of course not.
You mean, I have your permission?
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
What? What are you doing?
I hate trees!
They don't bother me.
What was that?
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
Thank you.
How'd you know it was me?
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Say thank you.
How do you do it?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
Oh, yeah.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
That's scary sounding.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
I think so.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
Okay.
Just a minute, Johnson!
Fred Duggar?
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
I'm not expecting anyone.
That's not what he thinks.
If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
Certainly not.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
The police?
Not my birthday again?
You're only six-five once.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Are you busy?
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Well...
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
George . . . George . . . George . . .
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Who else you been to see?
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
You know why?  She was so -
Sure, sure.
I'm going back there.
Who else did you see?
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
He made an awful lot of money.
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
What mess?
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
What?
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
Tell me what?
I just told you.
How close are you?
What?
Well... THIS.
You wrote his scripts for him?
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his  what about before that?
Before what?
Are we leaving mommy?
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
But of course yours worked.
Drink up, it's party time.
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
Yes.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
Oh, you were there?
No, but I heard it was great.
Well, I saw you and--
Harder...
Rowan...
HARDER!
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Not an easy day to forget.
No.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
You're really crazy.
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
You found her?
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
We need you here. I can bring her in.
How'd you find me?
Wasn't that hard.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
Too early to tell.
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Lauren's not my wife.
Girlfriend?
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Something.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Is the social studies class over for today?
I am prepared to do that anyway.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
She's changed.
Oh, yes.
Can't let you in...  sorry.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
Your name was picked.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
A list.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Well there....  What's the difference?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Lee!
Eric, your parents are both here.
In Costa Rica?
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
I know.
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
That's all right, that's all right...
On accounta...
He came in through the cupboard.
Don't you think we have enough?
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
This is the worst night...
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yes.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
Then I will go with you.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
I know how to fight!
How do you feel?
You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
I killed too many barbarians.
Stay.
I can't.
Vomit?
What if she called the cops?
Yes? What is it?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
That's right.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
You mean for TV or print?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Hello, Dorothy. 
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
Get the hell off of me!
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
Need a ride?
God, what a bunch of retards...
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
Course I did.
This is your car.
Will the Senator yield?
For a question!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
For one week!
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
You take care.
No!...  WE didn't anything...
Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
Yeah, let's bury her.
Is this being recorded?
This is just an informal discussion.
Are you recording it?
What does it look like?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
No. Why should it?
Well, then?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Take another look at these two.
I don't know them.
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
Is that so?
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
My, my... Ah, who are you?
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
I was listening, Kitten.
Why should I?
Now...where were we?
A rope!
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
What are these people?
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
What else?
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Keeping the Fix happy.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
Really?
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
I'll see to Pearl.
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
Here
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
What do you mean??
Well the other night at dinner...
Oh that, she just likes to play.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
Harry, I really think she.....
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
Never.
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
What's he get if he wins here?
You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
I'm sorry.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
We had to finalize the deal.
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
You got my cell. Leave a message.
We must take action on this immediately.
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
What?
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
I don't care! We'd be together.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
I want to fly, sir!
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
I want to fly jets, sir!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
No, sir!
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
Pity you don't have the character.
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Almost right.
I can't wait to meet her.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
Viktor, it's my studio.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
What's the travelling arrangements?
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
And where do you keep Mickey?
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
Who?
Wayne Gayle.
What song, dear?
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Five times a day?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
Well, you know what I mean.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
I'm exaggerating.
How much?
Jackie --
What?
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
He does?
Well yes -- you know that about George.
It's been so long I don't how long?
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
I would say so, yes.
Honey?
What?
How do you spell her last name?
Kubelik -- with two k's.
Joe, that's the kitchen.
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
Then take the pills.
Do you want me to stop calling?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
I was?
My face tell you all that?
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
I adore him.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
We've only been over this how many times?
You only made half your quote this year.
Well, you're a tower of support.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
Could it have damaged the ship?
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
How are you doing?
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
Oh, and what did you do?
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
Thank God.
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
Whew.
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
Stu...LOOK!
What?
What's a'matter?
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
How much?
$20.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
From who?
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
She couldn't.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
Right.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
Please.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Those two guys were cops.
You sure?
Agent Mackelway?
Yes.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Yes, sir.
Hey, darlin'.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
How much do you owe me, Curly?
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
I don't know...
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Plus what I owe you?
I'll throw that in too.
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
I don't understand.
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
How long will this take?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
She lives near Eddie?
I think she lives down by Pitt.
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
I think by Twenty-two.
For real?
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Please let me help you.
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
What do you want?
It's me. Nicky.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
What pills?
Prescription. For my condition.
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil!
Voil what?
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Give it to me!
Come and get it.
Just give it to me!!
Just come and get it...right here!
Of course I saw it.
Did you see the winning run score?
We are so fucked.
Where's Karen?
Elliot!
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
What?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
Maybe.
He's burning up.
Total delirium.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Push 'em back.
Have we met before?
No.
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Maybe... I... don't...
What about Philip Swann?
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
He will be waiting...
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
How're you holding up?
Who's winning, Mama?
What about the princess?
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Who?
Guess.
How should I know?
Someone from the past.
Who?
Give up?
YES.
Maxine.
Not the Maxine?
Yup.
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
I hope you liked it.
Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Why do you ask?
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
This gonna get you in trouble?
Insurance'll cover it.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
What list?
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
I don't... think so.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
Well, I have to file a claim...
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Don't I?
Do what you like.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
A hotel?
Yeah.
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
I don't follow...
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
Huh?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
No, I...
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
Yes, you can.
Thank you.
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
What's that?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
What?
Why we're just standing here.
She was a good woman.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
I don't understa-
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
Sure.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
What went off?
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
After all I've done for you --
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
She isn't my cousin.
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
They're holding position.
And?
They will obey, Praetor.
Mattie.  What about this?
I need it.
'Least you admit it.
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
What about Childs?
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
Walter.
It was my mother's.
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
How do you know what my father thought - -
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life you've ruined mine 
You were father's secretary - I never thought - -
I've got a lock!  There!
Look at these guys.
Yeah.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
Oh! Italian, right?
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
Oh, yeah?
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
I-I c-can't...
Maybe we should do some exercise.
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
What's a ditty again?
It's like a song.
We understand.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
And it killed Bo?
Foooooood!
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
What is it? Are you OK?
Always the drugs.
What?
I saw you talking to my Mom.
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
That's right...
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
I said let's go.
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
Say it, goddamn it!
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
No. No you're not.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
She'll tell them everything...
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Maybe.
Don't you care?
There's very little I can do about it.
Maybe we should just leave --
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --
Really? Did you play in a band?
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
Hmm?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Married?
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Tell me.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
Joyce was screwing Del.
...among others.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
Did your father teach you humility?
She's . . .
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Yeah?
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Thanks.
Hey, you two! What's going on?
A lot?
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
What is it, Hal?
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Burn them.
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
I can't do it.
You positive about that?
What what are you doing here?
Come back.
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
I really think you're
You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
What about him?
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
Is there something else?
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
Game's over, Eddie.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
Finished?
He's gone.
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
...For ten years, now.
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
Well, what about artificial insemination?
What are you talking about?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
Your bag?
Yes, my bag!
Didn't you take it with you?
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
No--I'm sorry.
But you saw it here.
Yes, I saw it--but--
All right.
So what's the argument?
No argument.
<u>He</u> died.
What?
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Why don't you come back with me?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
I don't understand.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
How did they find out?
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Weirder than this?
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
I'm calling it three.
We're half a million off.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
Ellie -- are you okay?
I'm -- I'm fine.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
Wait -- hold on a minute --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
What day?
Violet!
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
Good-bye, Peter.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
So where is the lamb?
Do you really need these?
Only to see.
Can't you get contacts?
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
Are you staying?
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
What?
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
I don't know.
What was her name?
That's not necessary.  You're in.
Thank you.
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
I wouldn't say encouraged.
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Not in those words.
You should come into the shelter.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
Come over after I'm done here?
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
You rat.
What does that mean?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Nothing?
The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...
Hear, hear...
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
No! I want to talk about it now!
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Why not?!
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Calm yourself, Bones.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
Good Lord!
Jack, we'd better go.
Jesus what the hell is that?
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Who at?
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
The lobby's half filled now.
Well, good night, Louis.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
You don't believe in God anymore.
Singed a bit, were you?
Animals that -- that eat straw?
Yeah?
Nobody's going anywhere--
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
Time to impact...?
Twelve seconds...!
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
Upham?
Pass.
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
What are you talking about?
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
I had no idea you'd be this good!
Reverend Mother?
Yes?
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
How did you get this number?
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
What is with you tonight?
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Now what?
Hardy, what are you doing --
We need guns.
We don't need guns.
I think we might.
He didn't say we need guns.
He implied it.
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
Do I know you?
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
You don't understand.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Will you let me explain!
And what're you whispering for?
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
Bob. Bob Destephano.
What?
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Computer guy.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
...worst possible time for me.
A record of the arrests...
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
I don't find your language that charming.
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
I don't know what you mean.
What's she doing here?
Yes, O'Reilly?
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
You're happy, aren't you?
La de da da...
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
That'd be fine.
At your service, sir.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
I want to do him!
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
What are you talking about -- who?
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
What now ?
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
How long they been livin' here?
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
What, Sergeant?
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
