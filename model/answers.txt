No shit.
No --
What?
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
I know.  It sucks.
Wow...
Yeah, really.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
You know they invented something while you were inside.  Called a watch.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
It won't work.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Who?
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
That always used to work.
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
Well...
Dad... 
Your father never means to be so...
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Some kids were teasing you?
That's not really the point.
Try the closet.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Any bodyguards?
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
Fine.
Tonight.
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
Do you want to talk to him?
Your parents met her.
Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back.
End of line.
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
I've had worse.
We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
The costumes.  Am I right?
It looks delicious.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
You were there.
You're intolerable today.
Watch your language.
Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
You hear trouble.
What is it?
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Okay, guys, we're gonna leave.  Let's get the check.
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Last night? What do you mean?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
No, I have my things in the car.
Then stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better.
God--what a Big League move.
Yesterday.
You'd have been proud of her.
I'm sure.
She was a revelation...
To you, too?
What do you mean?
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
That's beside the point.
It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!
Charles, what time is it?
Is this Charles?
What time is it?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
And?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Right.
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
I have plans.
Guess so ...
Sonny, come on out!
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
Yeah.
You don't understand--
Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
Sleep.
Just take it, OK.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
Nostrovia.
La'chiem.
Slanta.
Rinka.
Banzai.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot and cold running water -- You see, I can get a bath whenever I like.
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
Yeah.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
That bad huh?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
Buffy?
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
No, no medicine!
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
I didn't.
Some kinds of women are...
Nothing.
You haven't smoked in two years.
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
No, they don't, do they?
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
Miracles do happen.
Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.
Christ, what is going on in there?
Whatever gave you that idea?
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
What do they do up there?
Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
Why do they tell little kids that?
If you find her...
That is true.
Hi... am I late?
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
Good-bye.
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Uh-huh.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
And why do you say that?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
... bottle ...
Red ...
... head ...
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
The Websters.
The Websters!
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
Harlan.
What?!  What about him?!
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
Now, Thelma, that is not...
Every suicide kills two.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Don't shoot yourself.
Why?
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways...
I wasn't expecting you.
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
All right, girls.  Who does this belong to?  Come on, now.  Speak up.  Sugar, I warned you!
I'm sorry.
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
Aw... that's so sweet.
I love you.
Do you? Do you really?
God, you have great legs.
Harry... snap out of it!
 What's it say? 
Forty-nine point four.
 It says forty- nine.
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
You put everything on the line because you...
You slept with the fucker!!
We're getting major structural damage.
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
Move!
What did it look like?
It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
Why are you here?
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
I see.
I'm not even sure why.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Just a little crazy.
Youre judging me?! Oh, thats a good one. Youre lying to me, youre lying to your family, and youre lying to yourself. But youre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
A building?
A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
It's gone now.
Where are we?
Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
What time of year?
Tuesdays ...
Wouldn't dream of it.
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
Uh-huh.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
No.
You sure?
Yes.
You better be, motherfucker.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
Sorry.  Not today.
But we have to match the other sketch.
I just feel more comfortable keeping it on.  You just said you didn't want me self-conscious.
Be specific.
Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
That'll blow the ship up.
Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
Yeah, geography.
Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
That's fine.
Who?
The elderly man I told you about.
Dunn.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
I know.
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
I just can't believe it.
This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  When you stand up and are counted.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
No... the heart's still beating!
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
My mind's not on guessing games.
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
Uh... two shooters!
Fan-fuckin-tastic!
Well, how about this?
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Oh, yeah. 
At least you walked.
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
You didn't do that badly.
She was too young for him.
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Yes.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
What about the accumulator...?
No, I understand.
He was slipping her a little extra cream.
You took Bill.
It's my nature.
And this is mine.
Ten minutes ago.
Go ahead, Jay.
Yes.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
There are no stories anymore.
Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient evil.
What do you mean?
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?
No! Oh God.
What's happening!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
To him? He's a sick freak.
He's passionate.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Marylin! Listen to me.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
But why him?
We told you. We realized we've always been in love.
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
Is that what you "heard"?
You're leaving me here alone?
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
Hell yes!
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
I already ate.
Hi.
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Are you sure?
What can I do about it?
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
"But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
Yes.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
Oh, okay.
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
Have fun storming the castle.
Think it'll work?
It would take a miracle. Bye!
Bye.
I've heard of it.
It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
Fuckin, Zookerman --
THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!
Mm-hm.
No thanks.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Opportunity?
May<u>be</u>.
... Aye sir...?
What is our condition?
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Picture, please.
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Thanks.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
That's what was estimated.
Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
Yes?
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Twenty miles?  I see.
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
We're almost done.  Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through. Right, great, sounds good!
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
I'm not.
Did you make me a tape?
I already made you two tapes.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
Send me a kiss.
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
Why?
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
A car?  You're going to buy a car?
You're not coming with us?
All right! Then call! At least, call!
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Same one you were reading the other night?
What night?
When you didn't come to the club.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
I called, you know.
Called? When?
From the club. You didn't answer.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
You were asleep when I got home, yes.
I know. Put Scott through college.
I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day.
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
I want them thrown in jail.
Sherry, Sherry...
Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
Good. I want to talk to you.
Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
Where is it?
I don' t know. It's someplace down in there....  ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
I don't think it's Shandor.
I'm not interested in blind dates.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Fine with me.
The baseball is mine.
No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
Have they sat down?
Everybody but us.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
I said we're leavin'.
I'm here.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
It's history. I gotta go.
All right.
A man with a death wish.
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
Let's see if you bleed green.
No, where is it?
On your pillow.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
I know.  How long will you be gone?
Just a few days.
Will you take me?
I can't.
Why do you have to go?
To do business.
I can help you.
Some day you will.
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Yes?
Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
Okay.
I'd like to make another tape.
Andy!
Oh!
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
What is it? I'm busy.
Just follow me.
Lie down.
Excuse me --
There has to be!
There isn't!  There's nothing under here but more floor.  Jesus fucking Christ!  We killed a man for nothing but floor.
Yeah, whatever.
Say, Schulz --
Jawohl?
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Jawohl.
Then droppen Sie dead!
Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
You did not ask me.
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
Keep back.
He tried to warn us ...
So what are you going to do about it?
What do you want me to do?
Show him who we are.
Yes.  God, Mom...
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
How could he?
His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Nine hundred...
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
Well, there's got to be a way...
Have you got a cigarette?
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
Yes, sure, that's fine. While I'm proving my innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick I ever did ... you're going to write editorials about every cocktail I ever drank. Anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning, if I did it.  Go on! Get out! I don't want to talk to you! 
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
You have no right here!
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
For the third time, yes.
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
Now, Fran --
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
What plate?
The license!  You get it?!
No.
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Did you make the plate?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
Yes, papa.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Was that difficult to get?
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
Your name. And --
Judy Barton.
Who you are --
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
-- and how you happen to be living here.
It's a place to live, that's all.
But you haven't lived here long.
About three years.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
I told you! Right here!
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Salina, Kansas!
You should learn a little patience.
Is that right?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
Not in mine.
Yeah.
No.
Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree.
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
It's been a long time.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
Flaws.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Boy overboard!
Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
When you have a moment.
I think it's time.
No other reason  no woman not the little Miss Gibson?
Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
Hey Rob.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Huh?
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like.  What the hell?
The day of our homicides.
Yah.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
I know you mean well.
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
They're stragglin'.
His letters will keep.
No...
Do you remember where you were?
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Where were you?
At...
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Mine too.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Can we make out now?
Okay.
Mara...?
No!
C'mon. I've got the car.
I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.
She'll never forgive me!
Bombs away!
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Why does everything you say sound like a threat?
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
Later.
What?
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Not know.
Tell me, damn you.
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Oh, I'll bet you have.
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
You inviting shee-it.
Ghostbusters.
Yeah?
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?
No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
Are we?
20 minutes?
Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.
Lock phasers and return fire!
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
And now we're all out of it.
I don't think so...
Dad!
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
A match for your son, I think.
A fine match.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Hungarian?
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
Johnny, I know, but...
Telegrams.
Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
Huh?
I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road.
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
Good idea, but he thought of it, too. We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out. No, this one is different. This one has seen us coming...
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Worth every penny.
You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
What about?
We'll discuss that in the board room.
Joey...
...Like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids...some sort of business...be in the bowling league...go to the ball games...
I'd rather have a knife.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
I'm working on it.
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
Wow!
I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
No.  What am I to do?
The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Let him patch up his own breeches...
Sssshh. Come here.
Barely.
Have you saved patients as "barely" alive as he was?
That big asshole nailed my windows.
Mine, too.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
Doug...
Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
I don't mind.
Thanks.
What happened?? Where are we?!
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
You're kidding --
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
What is that supposed to mean...?
I think its meaning is clear.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
That could be.
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
One moment, I'm not done with you...  Give him the file...
That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.  Imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you won't just tell the truth about what really happened. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAY FOR NIGHT [MESCALINE TRIP]
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
They're called squirbs.
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
Bullshit.
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
You've got no jurisdiction.
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
His spiritual mother...
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.
He's not in, Mr.?
Gittes.
May I ask what this is regarding?
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Since lunch.
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
He was expecting you?
Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
Because he likes you.
Me?
Yeah.
That's my boy!
Yeah?
You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
You're allergic to hay.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
I don't know.  What are they?
I found them in your file box.
Must be a spare set.
I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
If he tells, it won't come true!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
Well, we did in my family!
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
That's a shame.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Powas p'suasion.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
The other guy drew first.
Right!
Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith  teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
Yeah...
So who's the lucky guy?
Who?
The groom?
Is it all right if I stand up?
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
Yes.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
Yes.
Let go of my hand.
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
...alright, let me know when.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Yes, I am.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
You Harlin?
Nope.  Darrell.
Harlin around?
He's up at the Look Out.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
We need padded chairs.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
But why?  The students love us!
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
I see.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Got to.  Gondorff's ridin' the mark in from New York on the Century.
A what?
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
No food?
No food.  Not until sundown.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
How old is she?
Four.
Oh, she'll love it.
-- Standard.
Scanning body type.
Don't say it.
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
What?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
I'm not-
You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
What she call you?
Huh?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Lookin' at?
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Just a couple more . . .
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
Take care of it.
Benjamin.
Yes?
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Why don't you watch?
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
What?
When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
I don't know.
I'll never let go!
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Tom, you're all heart.
Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
I promise.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
The Metro.
Meet Col --
Yes. Say hello to Col --
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
Oh, no -- no!
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Oh, you....
Just a second!
Well, there's nobody special!
Fine.
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
What?
Meeting ... people.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
You're just an experiment, freako!
You will.
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
They won't.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
We can always do that, Duff.
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not really thinkin' about it. Anyway, don't want those white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
I told you.
Delongpre! Out of time!
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
Virus?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
Excuse me?
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
What, it left a note?
Some deal you did there!
I should have read the fine print.  I love you Holly, thanks.
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
-- do you wanna cup?
That's great, thank you.
Paul D.
Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
Okay.
Really?
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.
What??
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
Nobody has.  So far.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
That's true
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
That's true.
Thank you very much, Hal.
I said that's enough!
He's asleep.
Always?
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
The driveway's on my side of the house.
We're talking.
What?
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Now let's keep going here.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Right.
Thank you.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
We don't.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
No we don't.
Well how long has this been going on.
About five years.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
No.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
How many times a year.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Man, is this interesting.
Is it?
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Not exactly.
But you don't hate him.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
I don't.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Is it?
I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
Come, come, don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way.  I'm even a little glad that Wesley's difficulty brought us together.
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
We'll discuss this later. Obviously.  You left the door open.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
Oh!  You scared me.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
Yes, sir.  They are indeed. 
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
How often do you go through this little ritual?
Little bit.  Yeah.
Yah.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Yah.
I myself --
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
Maybe a couple million.
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
Candy.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Let's talk in the hall.
It's okay. We need to talk.
Maybe he just went to the store.
He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.
Hi.
How're you getting on?
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
The prom?  Kat has a date?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
You just haven't been looking.
Would you like to see my apartment?
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
I always favored the Hulk.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Aw, fuck.
What.
Why didn't he shoot you?
I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen he talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
Is that a fact?
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
I'm not sure.
Has anyone checked the coring room?
You got any money?
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
The clerk?
And?
Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
What's the terrain down there?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Is it solid?
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Then take her down.
Drop begins... now!  Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing.  Five. Three.  Two.  One kilometer and slowing.  Lock tractor beams.
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Them who?
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
In the car.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
I know, I need a keeper.
Hit me.
That's twenty up, Martini.  Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game?
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
"Applicant?"
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
"Training?"  Tyler...
Didn't everybody?
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
You take care.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
How's he doing?
I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
She talks to herself.
I do.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
A statement?
Hold it, Jim.
You can't protect me.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
I know.  That was for the smell.
Who's leading them?
I don't know! Nehru, Patel, almost every Congress Official is in jail... and their wives and their children -- we've even arrested Nehru's mother.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
That's ridiculous.
I have to ask you for that key.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
Fuck 'em.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Oh you do, huh?
Just a little something' somethin'.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
No, before my time.
You don't read, do you?
Never read a book in my whole life.
Maybe you need to start.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Go, Mickey.
We're going to freeze to death.
O.K. O.K.
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Oh, do yuh?
Yes.
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Mr. Malkovich?
Who's calling?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
How'd you get this number?
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
Right, Mike.
It was nothing.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Okay.
Eyes closed.
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
Body double.
For her?
For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
Sounds boring.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
You don't.
Me neither.
Let the law --
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
I understand.
I love you, my brother.
I love you, Black.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Show me.
I know.
A what?
My suitcase - with all my resort clothes.
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
That's not what I was worried about.
The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
...I know.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
Yes. It's almost there.
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
Christopher Marlowe at your service.
Okay.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
No.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
He said you say that!  He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
Which is?
There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Well, why not?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Lyndon Johnson?
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Tsch.
The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
Maybe less...
What's your point?
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
How about Magruder?
He checks too.
That leaves two strangers.
So far.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
She might.
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
Who are you?
Let me talk to the lady again.
There's no lady here.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Hold on.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
Let her tell you.
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
That's what I said.
Told each other everything.  That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?
Senator?
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
I don't think so. It's nice.
Yeah, well, it depends on the artist. You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no complaints. Waiter!
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
Here.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Marg! You got orders!
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
Don't worry, I have 33 more days to find just the perfect moment to tell him how I...
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
Mr. Cedar!
Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Cash.
It'll only work for one of us.
Yes, sir.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
Got any requests?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
How about I pick one out for you?
That's reassuring.
That's comforting.
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
Right.  I know --
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
I'm in.
It's foolproof.  We got a partner downtown runs the central office of the Western Union.  Race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies.  All he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner.  Then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run.  It can't miss, unless the Western Union Dicks get onto it.
I know.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
This a con?
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Few minutes?
...Ten minutes.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
I know.
Two.
Are there many windows?
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Then it's a respectable house.
He was.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
Yes.
Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
Please! Just one moment.
This bad cop. He checked you into the			  * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you		    * for days, sticking envelopes under your			* door, telling you shit.						 *
Hi.
Did you have affairs?
Mr. Gittes.
Did he know?
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?
No more! You see? Watch!
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
Wired?    I ain't wired.
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
Good question.
No it's not. It was Jason.
Afraid not.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
No hard feelings?
Yes.
I just wondered.
Just wondered what?
Why.
Why what?
Why you have to go out there.
I don't have to. I want to.
Is it the money?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
I just asked a simple question.
And I shot my mouth off. Nothing personal, junior, no offense...  ... it's just that there's so much bushwah in this Ivory Green Room they call the Theatuh - sometimes it gets up around my chin...
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
Think again!
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
What?  What popped in there?
Look!
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Far too long.
Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
No, I don't mind.
When else are you gonna do it?
You know what he is talking about here?
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
I think think a lie stinks.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
Stinks. I could never figure --  I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes.
If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
I pay you too much.
There's a vague similarity.
A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
That's it!
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men.  No one goes near that thing.
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
Calm down, you're not ...
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
Elvis has left the building.
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
Really? Why?
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
You burned the score?
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
How fortunate.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
With all my heart, Mozart.
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
That was so demeaning...
She smiled, baby.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I know she's coming back.
I don't think so.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
You think so?
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
She likes you.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
I don't know...
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
That's bullshit.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
...gotta...
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
And who may you be?
Edward Wood, Sir.
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
H-how'd you know?!
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
Sure.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Where's the girl?
Upstairs. Why?
I want to see her.
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself  tell the truth --
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
You sure you know how to do this.
Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
One year...almost one year.
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
That don't seem fair.
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
Less ten percent.
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
That you, Rog?
Yes?
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.
Oh?
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
Don't yell at me!  I know it's here! I know it!
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
No!...No!...
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
I, actually yes.
I love Jewish men.
Why?
<u>You</u> know...Where's your bathroom?
As far as -- Sonora?
Just about.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Fucking drunk, huh?
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
You're out of your mind.
I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
Only if you really, truly mean it.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
That a fact?
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
Yes, I have.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
I . . . can't . . . argue . . .
Come to me, boy!
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
I'll keep that in mind.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
Nice to run into you again.
Let's not make it a habit.
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
Fuckin' A --
Would Walter really press charges?
It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
Not particularly.
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
I'm just here with another girl.
Where you going now?
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
I'll see you around.
I'll see you.
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
I'm not supposed to tell.
But you've not told Michael.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant.
They're not.
He'll have you -- and Tom.
No. That's all finished.
I'm sorry.
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
I don't know ...
Please.
She didn't call Tyler.  I'm neutral in her book.
Ask your girlfriend.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
And you met Mary how?
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
How'd you manage that one?
Friend. Baseball bat.
Nice.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Why you son of a --
That's right!
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
Little late for that.
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Leave a tip.
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
Ten grand! I mean, what other poolroom is there in the country where a guy can walk out with ten grand in one night? Jeez, you know, I can remember hustling an old man for a dime a game.
Yes, I do -- very much.
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
Of course, my dear.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
Never threaten me, Boss.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
Suit yourself.
When?
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
The kid needs a man to show him --
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
It's from Paris.
Forgive me, I beg you --
What is it?
The god of the cave.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
I used to, but I stopped.
You stopped?  Why?
Because I don't want cancer.
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Hello!  Hello!  Have a good flight?
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
Yes, M'sieu Laval!
This I know, Benny.
This you're familia' with.
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
I just got out here!
It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
His only copy?
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
You don't believe me, huh?  Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book.
Why?
Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
Try stupid.
It's called pro bono.
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
It's my bit for the community.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
Where was this?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
Have women found you attractive?
Ellis, what have you told them?
I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
No.
You like kids.
I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
No, I figure he stays here.  Where's your registration?
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
How'd you know about that?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
Yeah, Edwin, <u>sure</u>... and <u>Pinnochio</u> is a true story... <u>Edwin!  Wake up!</u> This is a fairytale...
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
You didn't jump in.
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
Seemed, not was.
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Really?  Hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Here.
What's that?
Bracelets.
Oh, Mr. Martins...
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
I'm back from the dead.
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
No... it's life.
Yeah?
I think we're lost.
You have a map.
I know... but we left the main trail... and I can't find any landmarks around here... I've been trying to figure it out but...
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
You jackass!  C'mon, let's get out of here.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
I didn't get any chicken.
How come?
It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
Yesssss...
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Please, God, no...
They was a boy. We made friends.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
It's too big.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
I thought they locked you in your room.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Can you get into the office?
I can get into the den.  The office is right across the hall.
I know, Dad!
It's a new experience for me.
It happens to me all the time.
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
Whose show was this on?
Jed's got cables.
Go to sleep.
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
What happened?
She... went into the Bay.
Your bed?
Under my covers.  Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Why did you phrase it like that?
Like what?
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
You gotta be kidding.
How different?
As different as it's possible to be.
Tell me about him.
No.
Shouldn't I go?
Yes.
Oh really?
Nothing.
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
Captain... I'd like to go along...
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
Of course you are.
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well...
Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldve been really good friends...
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
No, I got it. It's okay.
What happened?
I.  Yes.  It is.
And you wrote that...
Yes.
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
Thank you.
Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
Did you like her to watch?
Do you think I told her to kill You?
No.
Everybody that I care about dies.
Just stay in bed and rest.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
I will appreciate that.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Why's that?
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
How soon?
Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
Where you staying now?
Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
Tell me some bad news?
I don't want to ruin your day.
That bad?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
So I hear.
Huh?
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
They ain't the only ones.
Oh, I hate the other kind.
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
Dorkatops!
Hardly ever.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
It does.
Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe.
Yes, sir...
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
I know...  But you do look so silly.
You're kidding, right?
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
What?
I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
...that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
From this box here...
Its just two kids, right?
So what? We'd be rich!
Don't you understand? The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear.
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Five million dollars?
Five million dollars.
Not even a guess?

Don't call me that --
The Trail of Tears.
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
So they stayed in Florida?
They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass.
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
No.
Well then.
He killed the dolphin.
It's true.
And who did the voice belong to?
It was just a voice.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Daddy, it's true.
Let me be the judge of that.
How did you know that?
I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
I don't care what she wears.
Something's made you sore.
Don't worry about it.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
Kid--kid--
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
What's this?
Don't!
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
You won't have to.
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
Thank you, Jack.
You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?
Aw, Betty.
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
That's enough...Go on inside and help Lucy set the table...You, too, Deborah!
Welcome to work, Ed.
Come with me, honey.
What do you mean?
Fluid is seeping through. Better come down and have a look!
Start of what?
I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished...
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Eighteen--  and a half.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Sir?
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
What time do you get off work, my child?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
I'm engaged.
Daughter--I love you very much.
You don't even know me.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
This is crazy.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
What do you do for a living?
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
Some kind of animal?
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
That's where I peed.
what?
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear?
Correct.
You're right.
For a butt-head? Yes.
No you're not.
I'm not?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Why would I do that?
Because that's my name.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Or what?
That's what they pay me for.
A great deal more than that, I believe...
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
No.
Falling.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon, cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
You bitch!
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
FUCK YOU! 
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
I've had a--
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
That would be too easy.
Too easy?
He's gotta know why.
You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will?  What more do you want, man?
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
What are you going to do?
You're crazy.
<u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you.  You panicked.  Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Maybe what you need is another agent.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
You're kidding.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
I'll back that up.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
No, you're not.
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
What?
Spade's a garden tool....
He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
An attempted slit.
Sssssh.
Charmed, I'm sure.
I had to test you.
But you threw a knife at my head!
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to.
You could do that?
Yes.  That's who I want to be.
Primary trigger switch.
C'mon, Laurant, America?
The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- at-at--
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
How you been, Ellis?
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
I am older.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
Didn't know there was any.
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
And you, do you believe?
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
You really think so... us?
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
You want an address on that last one?
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Of course not. Anyway, somebody up there wants you out of the way.
Orders.
To kill me?
Nothing personal.
Nothing, just lookin'.
I've never done this before.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up."  Poor fatty never had a chance.
I don't like her.
I do, she's real funny.
He likes her better than me.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
Then go home, baby.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
Leave then, some friend you are.
You can come to my house for dinner?
No, I'm hiding out.
Okay, seeya.
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
There's something going on, Z --
Yes.
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
I'm a tourist.
You at least bring the gun?
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
I don't know...
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
What'll it be Fletch?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Uh...sure...when?
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Now?
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar?
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
You are acting like one!
I will be the judge of that.
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
You shame yourself.
Why?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
The things a girl has to put up with.
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you.
I'd like to go back. James...
Not yet. It's only beginning.
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
Vegas!
Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
They called here after you left...
She's okay.  Everything's okay...
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
Jealous?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
He told me they knew I was coming here.
What do you mean -- how?
The old man saw it in a dream.
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Always.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
Anna, I think you better stay....
You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
Hey, man, I'm not--
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
The Gundersons.
The?  Who the fff--
The Gundersons.  It's a wandering daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Gunderson. Her parents want her back.
That's not what you were about to say.
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
My suitcase was vibrating?
Nine time out of ten, it's an electric razor.  But, every once in a while ...  ...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.  We use the indefinite aricle: "A dildo."  Never "Your dildo."
But all these people...
<u>Now</u>.
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
You know who I am. You invited me.
Shoot.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
-- listen to the man --
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
Not so long--just once around the sun.
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
Okay, let's take a look.
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
I put in a word for you with the organization--told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday...Might be an opening at Salem next year--
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
What's cookin', Bert?
I tell you what's cooking.  She made the blind see and it was a gift!  Who was it from?  Let's hear an 'F" for...
No, we'll find something around here.
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
You know that song?
All right - I've seen enough!
Okay.
We might as well pack.
Good idea.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Claire is your wife?
Yes.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
I'm sorry.
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
She'll forget about us eventually.
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
Yes?
Order me a pastrami for after?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Thanks.
Welcome, Howard.
Stay to your left.
Ever see one like this?
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
Breathe easy...
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
There is?
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Just relax.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
All right.  It was...
And you don't ask questions?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
Does that mean...?
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
A Broadway shopping bag.
Don't.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
It's Saturday.
I don't think about it.
Yes... I guess I knew that.
You better not have too much joy.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Gonna get married...
I'll be back when I can.
Hello?
<i>We gotta go to work, Domino.</i>
`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
I do.  Yes.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
That's not my handwriting.
You've just said you signed it.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
Because I kept a copy.  I have it right here.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
Take us to Vegas.
I don't know.
Thorgan, suit up.
This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program?
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
I'll getcha a piece.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Oh, you do?
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Oh, right.
Nice car.
Huh?
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
Anna Moss.
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
Ready, your Honor.
Defense...?
What does he mean by "target audience"?
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
You're dead.
So are you!
I don't know what you're talking about.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Stuckey!  He wants an "appointment" with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
I told you they were there.
So it's my fault?
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
I tell you, I saw them!
I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
I'm his cousin.
Vanity Fair?
Can't this thing go any faster?
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
They don't know this.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Dad...
All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Right behind you.
Somehow I expected not.
Run for what?
Can't you see?  It's raining!
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
You talk as though you intend on staying.
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
Why?
Where are you, anyway?
Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
Half a Dirty Dozen!
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
A man might what?
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
Oh -- you would!
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Thank you for calling the white House...
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
While they're strung out?
Exactly.  We'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard.  It would cause the line to buckle. Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Bull.
Alright, suit yourself.
He's comin' back? What for?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Oh he forced you, huh?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
Huh?
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..
What the hell is that smell?
No thanks. I don't drink.
Yeah. I forgot.
Yes.
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
Dynamite?
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
What does that mean?
It means it was homemade.
This is... really a shock...
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
Who do you think could've done this?
I'll ask the questions, son.
Do what?
This.
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
What is that?
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
Yes.
What did he look like?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
He had an orange hat on.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
What?
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
You got it.
And incidental damages, if any...
You got it.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
You got it.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
Try some of this. I made it myself.
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
I'll be your winger.
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
I did it!  I got the box open.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
We're making an investment in Havana.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
I never met them.
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
That's what I'm here for.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these Washington suckers right where you want 'em.  Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He always wanted to die in bed...with a broad.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
I can't...
You got till the count of three. Then you end up like him.
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
What about Ganz?
Yes - of course.
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
Hello, Venkman.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
I don't even want to know where that is.
Mine.
Duh.
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
He has the camera!  He took the movie!
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
Crime of passion.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
But you were punished.
Yes. I went to jail.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Regret.
What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.
You've done it again?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
What is her disposition?
Yeah, guy?
Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy. 
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
I'm your creator now.
A videotape.
Who's it from?
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Does it say anything on the tape?
No, nothing.
Did you see the old man on the ---
Michael!
John, I don't understand any of this.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
John, why?...
Just do it!
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
Said who?  Sugar?
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
I'm sorry, I --
I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
Yes, Doctor. Please.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
That's an order.
Sorry, Sir.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
You think Drew will go for it?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Not anymore!
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Yeah. Guess not.
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
What the hell you doing?
Helping him in.
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.


I told you --
What can I do?
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
I... I can't!
You have to...
No!
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
-- Thanks, coach --
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
That's home.
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
For going to school?
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Good for her.
I'll take the whole set.
Excellent.
Dad was onto something here!
Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
Think about what?
Yep.
Oh Norville, I --
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Airport.
Well -- where ya goin'?
I don't know.
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
With food?
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
I don't believe it.
Over my dead body.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
I thank you.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
No. No. The guy from downtown.
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
Oh I Him.
It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
Yes, Sir.
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.  C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>

She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
Yup!
Recognize these two characters?
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
What are you doing here?
Checking out the competition.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What else is there?
You know what I'm talking about.
Don't you even know your letters?
Now you're lying.
You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
Sure.
What kind of beer would you like?
I don't know.
Give her Miller's. Miller's High Life.
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
That it's about to go wrong.
Panther!  Same thing...
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Not if I shoot first!
I don't even think you have a gun!
Neither do I!
No Sir.
Got your license?
Yes.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
I can't sleep nights.
There's porno theatres for that.
I know. I tried that.
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
Murderer.
I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
It's been a few years.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
I'd believe him.
Why?
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
She talks a great deal and smiles a lot. She's very pretty, she has a real good figure. She's very girlish or womanish, if you know what I mean. She wouldn't hurt anybody, this girl. She couldn't.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
What?
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Yeah, that's right.
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
Thanks, but I'll manage.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
Is Mae Rose okay?
She's doing just fine.
And the baby?
He's a big one.
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Oh, he's sitting up.
Good.
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
Looks like she was holding out.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
No, sir?
My change.
Change?
A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph.
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
On a good run... yeah.
So you're a wire junkie.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!
How much ya wanna bet?
Ten bucks.
You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
Poor, yeah.
But not you.
Tell them you'll meet them outside.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Go home, Sheila.
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
No.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Because you were jealous.  Because he cut you out of the will.  Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
The good-looking one.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
Enough already about it - get to work!
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Manages what?
His escape.
Oh, but I just told you. --
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
This is the end of the chase.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
Come on.  Hand over.
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
They're all heavily armed.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
What was it?
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
Derek Mantini!
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Fundoscopic examination --
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
She's a very... determined woman.  Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
Who's Dil?
My special friend.
Oh, yeah.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
The best.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Do you?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
We don't look on it like that.
I've often wondered how you do it.
Depends on what you believe in.
What do you believe in?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
It's as simple as that?
Yes.
Sure.
It's all we got.
Okay, don't worry about it.  Stick it in the bag...
Be smart about it.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
You don't have to wait three days...
...Okay, two...
...just be smart about it.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
If I go to jail...?
I'll knit you a sweater.
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
No... But...
One day he's gonna find out what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
It's too far.
Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
He will be alright.
I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
I hope it works.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
How'm I doing so far?
So far you're great.  You got a cigarette?
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Getting ready.
Look. You want to talk about this?
I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
Understanding of what?
Like I might be in love with another woman.
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
What? Of course I like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
Everyone needs something.
Yeah.
What kind?
Kitchen. . . Technician
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Nope, but --
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Thirty-five.
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
A television set?
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
I know, I'm the fault.
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
What about this week's check?

I didn't say...
No, Holiness.
Am I running away?
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
Jefferson--
Yes, Ma?
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some plaster for a cast on Amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off. I'll only be a minute--if you'll excuse me, sir--
You're an asshole.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
Multiple reasons.
Name one.
I don't have to...
I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
Yes.
....I have seven.
Naw, you go first.
You go first.
No.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
Yeah?  Me too...
Yo, I'm gone.
I'll see ya there.
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
Shit and fried eggs.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
Me too.
Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
It's me, Yuri.
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
My promise.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
No, they don't.
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Wanted what?
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
That isn't true! Max?
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
I don't know.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
Geez, don't listen to them.
Shut the fuck up.
Yes, sir.
One week at the most!?
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
I can't do it.
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
Yes.
Can you walk?
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
Why can't it be her?
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
You - are - a - murderer.
But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
Well, sir, I putter.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
I just putter.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Well sir, I'll show you.
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
...Well, I have the worst  headache, I have to go find some aspirin. But, call me, let's have a drink, I'm under Evelyn Waugh.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
We're gonna try.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
The Conformist.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
You haven't even seen it!
Nor have you!
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
Do you think that's what he wants?
No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself?  Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.
Hello, Alan.
Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
I ...  ... am Titch.
You're too late.
Tipping me off? I do not understand.
You weren't helpin'.
Go douche.
What's wrong with this one?
You like it? Let's trade.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
What about bowling?
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
You're a scumbag.
Zuzu's petals.
What kind of whispering?
I don't know.  Just...whispering.
C'mere.
... Will Perry ...
Thicker than water.
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
Why? Is this about the book?
No. Frank.
Who's Frank?
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
It's a girl.
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
What happened? Oh my God...
Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
I can't sleep.
Oh... I got something for that.
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
The memory of who?
Shhh!
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
I could get the death penalty.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
An insanity defence.
I thought we were meeting here.
I'm here with Jenny.
So lie down.
Good!
Quiet.
Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
Thank you.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
A funeral.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Yeah.
How do you feel about him now ?
I don't know, Zander.
I do.
Thanks.
You're crazy!
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Stop calling me Max.
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Right, Max. California, Max.
Ah.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Forget it, Max.
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
I don't have love handles.
He lived through that?
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
Be my guest.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
I cry at the opera.
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing.
I was born.
When'd you see him last?
Today, over at the house.
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Like you taught me...
Bullshit, you're...No.  That's raw... well, if I did, then I'm glad I did.  I, well.  I locked on them.  All on them, nothing on me. All my thoughts are on them.  I'm holding the last thought that I spoke: "Now is the time."  They signed, Ricky.  It was great. It was fucking great.  It was like they wilted all at once.  No gesture...nothing.  Like together. 
Yeah, not really.
I saw a picture of you.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
No. I'm the exact opposite --
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
It's terrible, no.
Turn the tapes back on.
Fine.
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
No shit?
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
So, what are you doing tonight?
Shooting.
Shooting?
Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'Bye, Dad.
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
You scared me.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.
Wanda...
Oh yeah?
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
Yeah?...
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
I'm busy, man.
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
What?
I waited another four minutes.
Shit.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
Right.
I'm taking off my mike.
Okay.
Electra --
What?
Last night --
Quiet.
Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
I certainly hope not.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
What about not-so-great writers?
Bobby...
A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
What...?
Is this a bad time.
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
What happened...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
...and is that serious?
Of what?
Twenty-four-five.
Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty- two flat.
These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
It sure is.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
See Duff. He's the money man.
What d'you say, Duff?
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Oh, no, sir!
Good.  You're a good soldier.
Thank you, sir.
Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.
Maybe it's not me.
Call the number.
Good morning, sir.
You've acquired a taste for this?
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
Mother, please...
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Shut up! Shut up!
Let her go, Craig. I mean him."
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
Honey --!
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
Its okay. The cops did it.
I know.
They busted me last week.
They bust you every week.
I know. I got bad luck or something.
Here?
It's my day off.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
Well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you'll find.  I'd better come along and show you the town.
At the Zoo.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
I've never been to it.
Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
I know it, I know it.
... this doing hair it's...
I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
Gabriel, let him go --
Read a lot about you, Nick.
What are you doing here?!
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Gabriel!
A man of some travels.
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
What do you want?
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
Are you hungry?
Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec.
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
Yes -- why?
I wanna powder my nose...
Tomorrow night?
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Jesus, man...
Please...
She's left before...
She's left the room before. She always came back.
Remember what I said, you can't...
Trust me.
They always paid.
Nope, he ain't Wade.
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
It's locked.
Make sure.
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
You mean "goodnight."
I mean what I said.
Thank you!
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
Cynthia's not coming?
No.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Darling, you're wonderful.
For Nicholai?
Yes.
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
Well, I have some paper towels --
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
So what are you waiting for -- a singing commercial?
That's it.
Good.
The hull's imploding!
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
I don't know.
What? He's going to be all right!
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Well, make it stop!
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
You know who I work for.
Bye.
Yes, by all means. We must try it.
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
Time to study.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.
Neo, this has to be done!
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
What are you talking about?
The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
We're waiting, Hubert.
Why not?
I'm robbing this place.
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Are we getting married?
It was very specific.
All right...
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
What happened after you smelled it?
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
Like she smelled it too?
Yes.
And then what happened?
I got more scared.
What?
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
I don't want to be just your friend --
You don't know what you want --
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
And why would that scare me?
Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Then why do you?
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
This knife is filthy.
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
We got it.  On your feet.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
I'm walking.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Sleeping's better.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
Excited.
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Finland.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
What's a Negro.
I'm sorry.
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
I'm saying it now!
So you met somebody else?
Yeah.
What did I do?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
All I did...
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
You're hurting my arm.
Harlin's.
Get in.
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
Don't mention it.
I don't even know your name.
No --
Somebody broke in.
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
Switek?
Yes!
The master ... is asleep!
He likes to play the great man.
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
What's your problem?
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Chicken salad.
Chicken salad, Devra!
Better.
Shush.
I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
What is what?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
On the contrary.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
No, but I'm the best.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Mozart -
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Mozart -
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
And--
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
Really?
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
Who?
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
No it couldn't.
Quiet!
What?
The art.
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
Eat shit....
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
And let us say...
You want me to go up with you?
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
Good. I don't want to be late.
Oh my God.
Don't look at me.
Who are you?
I said: don't look.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
So be it.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Boy, you must've been up early.
Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured  They got it made. Eat all they want fly around like crazy sleep side by side and raise gobs of squabs.
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
No!
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Not like that.
Then what?
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
I don't think I like the idea of you staying out all night with a girl!
The one on the left - definitely...
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
What's that, Diz ?
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
I like to read.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Sort of, um...
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
What?
I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
But I have to!
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
Look?
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Then what is it?
History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Plans?
Lucy.
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
I thought you were an expert.
Dr. Grant was.
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
And threw us into the lake.
Pretty much, yep.
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
What?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
What are you drunk?
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
What is?!
Show business.
You're in show business?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
Thumbsucker!
I'm making a tape.
We're excited.
Hi.
Come in, Admiral.
... including me.  Right?  
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
You mean,  me?
It's possible.
No.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
No.
Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.
Italian? The Mafia...?
Who knows. Who cares...  You wanted slime. You got slime.
You look like you have.
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
You've got to go.
Why?
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
Your boyfriend?
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
The best part of ten years.
That's what I call a payday.
Hell yeah.
No problem, boss.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
But what could she do?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
Well...
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
Promise.
I promise.
That's my Max.
You're not missing much.
What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
What?
I will, sir.
That's up to you.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Yes.
Then go.
Still lashed to the mast.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Maybe...?
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
The knife.  What knife?
By she, do you mean he?
No.
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
So what's the problem?
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
What are you going to do?
Shhh.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent. 
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
You are the prince of the darkness.
Anything else you want to tell me?
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Restless.
Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
You were expecting her? Huh?  ...It's a nasty business waiting by yourself. In company it's better. No?...Then I'll leave.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked.
Take me to the hotel.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
Go fuck yourself.
...It's really getting late.
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
Oooh! Here! Here!
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Get him!
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
In a minute.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Get your hands off of her.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Your dance is over.
Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
Resting?
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
What I think is going on with your son.
Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
Yeah.
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
No, but the whole goddamn  Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?
We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
Why?
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
Can't you have a normal conversation?
I don't want to have any conversation.
Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
You mean soap?
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Wonder where we'll be then.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Until it withers away.
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Yeah - Josephine.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
Here, get down.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
Oh, George, George!
You have no idea what's happened to me.
You have no idea what happened . . .
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Don't be a smart ass.
Its not supposed to be anything, Kat. Its just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I dont know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
Let me see the plant press.
I'm against that.
We've got to get out of this shower.
Now you're making sense.
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
What, am I supposed to read it while I drive?  Keep a grip on it, alright?
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
What else?
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
So have I.
From you, I like it.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
Goodnight, Claude.
You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
What a treat.
And - Anna...
Did the police believe you?
You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Why not?
Because my mom gets the bill.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
I don't want to use it.
Well, then cut it in half.
I keep it for emergencies.
Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
Sattler.
If there are, we'll all be dead.
I look pretty.
Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you...
Head hunting.
Good or evil, what's the difference?
What dead one on the ship?
Yes?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Virginia.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
That sounds fun.
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Six.
And how tall are you?
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
Do I know you?
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
The extrovert.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
You want me to leave?
I just want to know why you're here.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
She still is.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
Nope.
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
Nope.
She didn't give you my address?
Nope.
How did you find me?
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
Spooked.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
She said...
She wiped out her whole family.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Didn't you study it in school?
Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice.
Have you.
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Nice to meet you.
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
I think it's Hawkins.
Where the hell is his body?
There's no sign of it.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
You wouldn't.
Would.
You couldn't.
Could.
Where is it?
On a bench, across the street.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
That's right.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
Right.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
And people make their choice--
A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
Bruce?  What are you doing?
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Twenty years, Ma ...
Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
I don't know.
We'd better talk.
I'm listening.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
I sure would.
Maybe I could start you out.
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Yes, ma'am?
Welcome back.
Thank you, ma'am.
I hope everything is settled.
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
Good shooting, Rafe!
Land of the free...
Home of the brave!
There's another one!
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
I don't know it.  I feel it.
You make it sound so simple...
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
I'm not sure I can face it.
Keep me company.
I wasn't scratching!
You callin' him a liar?
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
I see.
I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious.
Yeah.
Mutants?!
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
What?
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
You afraid of the dark?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
More or less.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
He's looking right at me.
I'll assess all I want!
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
Are you on drugs right now?
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.  When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand?  I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
You use their witness.
That's right.
I think we tried that. The case is over.
Clear!
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Terminal?
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
It was.  It was.
That's all right.
Happy anniversary.
Sorry!
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
Alamo...
GUARD!!!
Mary Robert.
What do you fear?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Destiny.
My heart!
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
I thought you were an archer?
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
The King of England.  I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
Make me an offer.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
Hey, okay.
I know.
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
Is this a joke?
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
No.
A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.
Yes, ma'am.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Yes, ma'am.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
Why?
Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
I'll go to the Hospital.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Like Rome?
Worse.
You made out alright.
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
The tenth's out.
What?
I can't make the tenth.
What do you mean?
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Be reasonable, Jack.
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
Am I out of here?
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
There were treating me like a headcase.
Hard to believe.  You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken.  No sense of humor.  What did you expect?  An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
I can use your mom's.
I'm okay.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
If you need me, I'll be --
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Here, are you always this sarky?
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Weren't you on a television series?
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Now who's being sarcastic?
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
"Death and Taxes"?
Storm?  What storm?
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
They didn't tell me anything.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Wha --
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
Holding you... again.
Darling.
I need... to talk to you.
All right...
Not here... alone.  Please.
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
We found him like this --
Maybe.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
The strip joint?
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Don't say anything else.
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Quiet!
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
Alright.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
That's certainly possible.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
I have no problem with that.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
The pace?
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
Can you fix it?
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Code, I've heard a lot about this.
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
By the book, he's a sadist.
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
Yes.
Big through the hips. Roomy.
They all were.
Mmm. And what else...?
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
Was it a butterfly?
A moth... How did you predict that?
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
I speak what I feel.
Play something, Grace.
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
You're not going to ....
Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
True.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Correct.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast.  Anything from them yet?
Well... I think I saw her soul.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
What doesn't?
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
I never said that I believed...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
You need to remember who you're talking to...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
Wesley...
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
Go on, go on--
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--we will--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Did I scare you?
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
You don't know.
She didn't tell me.
Excuse me?
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
But wait, you don't understand-
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Already got a guilty conscience, Might as well have the money too.
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
Fuck you!
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh?  Fuck you!
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork.
The entrance is collapsing!
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
What a relief!
I haven't read that.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped." Would you?
No. Roy. Roy V.
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Seventy-five.
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
There's no one left ...
We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
Nothing. Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright. 
I'll go then.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
Whatever.
-- murdered by pirates is good --
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
She left me. She's gone again.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
She was my best thing.
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
Sorry.
You don't wanna be noticed?
Exactly.  Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines?  I'll do the part mute!
She wasn't a nun?
Sammy.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
It's me.
Nick?
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
I think he's already feeling better.
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
Why?
He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
No way.
That's where I always go when I get out.
It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
Who cares? Who cares?
Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
What's the matter with my printing?
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
There's nothing to tell.
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
No.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
You think?
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Probably not.
Shit!  Oh, shit. 

Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
No, don't say anything else!
Perfect.
I don't know which ball's mine.
Just the beast.
You serve martinis, doncha?
Yeah...
The...the gold...
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
When did you make the switch?
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
But...
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy.
That'd be Lily.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
All new people start with that...
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying. 
She is!
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
O-o-o-oh...
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
'K-k-kay, Mack!
Yeah.
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Oh my God, Steven.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
I'm now begging you.
Listen, since I got you on the phone -- ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker.  I'll send her right over.  Her name is Vicki.
What else?
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
Expensive?
She said they were from her old convent.
But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Hey, I'm eating.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
You want to be a good detective?
Yes, sir.
Then find me some cigarettes.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
You're kidding, right?  Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.
Like hell.  That counted.
You didn't buy batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
I can't believe you didn't check.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
You were going to can me, right?
Not really.
Not really?
I was upset.
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
Fletch.
If you like.
Never-r-r!
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
You get lonely?
What's the Blue Book price?
That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition.
Oh-yah.
I never saw him before!
My lettuce is wilting.
How do you mean?
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Ha un numero di telefono?
Before what?
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
What do I get for it?
You get it's brother.
Sounds like a fair swap.  Let's take a look.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
You know I can't do that.
Oh, I think you will.
Then change it.
How much closer would you say you were?
I don't remember.
Five feet?  Seven feet?
It wouldn't come.
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
Hey--that coffee?  You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
Nothing.  I'm sorry.
What?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
I'm not?
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
But...
Please!    It's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
...I saw nothing.
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
No!
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
Mama, shut up!
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
That's all past, Lestat.
Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
My condolences.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
Progress! It always arrives too late!
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Yeah, weird. But great.
Yeah. Definitely.
Ceremony?
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't.  You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste.
Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
How far away's the back-up?
Three minutes.
I promise.
A coup d'etat?
The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him.
Baby?  Right on time.
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
But why? He didn't weight the others.
It's a league record.
Struck out eighteen...
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.  They knew the Puritan was coming home.
What?
Why not?
Why not?
What's your opinion?
I believe Agnes is different.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
That's ridiculous...
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
So, someone else could have done it.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
And in your eyes?
I've already told you what I thought.
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
It's possible isn't it?
Who?
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
I know that.
Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision...  Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product.  They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
Oh...
What?
She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnt with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, hows your mother?
Shes getting better, thanks.  She...
Shit!  Apoc?
I'm an actress.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
Well, they can be.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Films mainly.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Fifteen million dollars.
Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
What?
I used to live here.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
Which?
The first and the last.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
Te...!
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
I suffer from insomnia.
Is that all?
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
I sleep like a dead horse. Anything else?
I heard that.
What was it?
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
What's baseball?
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Like a painting?
No, son. A pitcher.
Like one of Mom's?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
No. Sit down.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
What if it's during a game?
I told him if it was during league play--
I stick my neck out for nobody.
A wise foreign policy.
Key? Key? What is the key?
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
The key!
Where is it? What did you do with it?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
Happily married, probably.
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
Sure...
I have to.
When can I see, you again ?
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
You're serious?  You'd help me...
First the pets, Otis.
Sez who?
Sez me.
Not far from it...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
This is a slur on her good name.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
Nobody has any rights over me.
We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
Let me do something.
If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
You, Preacher?
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
The trees, eh...
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
I don't know!!
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Oh God, that's great!
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
Coming to the point, please.
Thank you.
I have guests waiting.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
Aye, sir.
Deanna, on my mark.
Ready, sir!
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
We moved rooms because of him.
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
When did he say it, Norma?
So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
So where do we start?
Why LA?
I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
You're welcome, Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
I just drove in this morning.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
You do?
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
And then you weren't there.
Right.  I'm sorry.
OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
Captain, we got a problem.
Now what?
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
Meurice--
You don't look too good. You sleep last night?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
Yes sir.
Thank you.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
Oh, god.  Look. Look.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
I miss Beast a lot, too.
Yes, wasn't it?
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
I'm sure you haven't any.
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Did you finish the interview?
The Criminal Courts Building.
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
Okay.
Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?
I can try.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck.  Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you. 
I don't know... he fell.
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
Someone put it on me.
Okay.  Lowell?
Yeah?
You're sure you want to do this?
Why?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
You ready...?
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
I'll heal.
What about Nomak?
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
I didn't know.
Can you shut it down?
'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
haka xuki. What's that mean?
Cash.
Did you get it?
So what?                                                    ]
Yeah, why should we let our actual personalities get in the way of us falling in love?
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
What's that?
You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.
Okay...thanks.
There'll be other shots.
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
I don't want to hear another word against him.  Not another word.  He's a wonderful man ...a wonderful man...
I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
It certainly does.
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
Colorado's closer
So're the Cowboys.  They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us.
He's a rapist. Like mine.
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
No. Why? Are you seducible?
And so I am.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
New York is dangerous place.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
About what?
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
I'm interested in mythology.
Have you ever heard of the Calan?
I'm a cop from New York.
New York...
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
The lieutenant wants the register.
It's none of your business.
Rae, all we got is each other.
I don't have any family any more.
I say a lot of things.
And like a fool I believe it.
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
What happened to the donut king?
Married.
You was in the Marines, huh?
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
John, how can you say that, after all these years--?  John?  John?
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
And what about the ones you don't save?
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
And what if you can't live with it?
You've got to decide that for yourself.
Baltus Van Tassel.
Did your father take a loan?
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Helmuth.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
Yeah.
You stood for like a month.
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
You could've asked.
You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Sure...
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Do they know yet?
Know what?
Where it came from?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
I know.    you are my son -
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
I know, but...
Whoever took it does.
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
Done?
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
You have ten seconds.
All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up.
Olivier's in that, right?
Then it's on to the real thing.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
Wish I could say the same.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
So don't show a picture.
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
...I don't know.
Shell-shocked!
Come on.  Ease off the girl.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Yes.
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Oh, God.
Do you see?
Please, no.
'No' what?
Not me.
Are you a man?
Yes.
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
God, no.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
No.
YOU'LL HIT US!
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Evidently.  Coming!
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am.
Not my imports.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
Who is he?
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
We want to meet him.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
Tell him we'll meet.
The Hunt Club.
To scare off humans?
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
Steve...
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
That is correct, Major.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
You know the regulations well, Major.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
And if that were true?
Matt, come here!
Why?
Come here, honey!
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Look, I don't know what you want--
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Oh?
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
You're also a fool.
I think you should go now.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
Put on another one.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
I am well, Admiral.
You will be in good hands here.
Darling!
We'll find out soon enough.
Me neither.
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
Opportunities?
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him.  Like that!
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
That you've been to Susan?
I wasn't going to say --
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
What money?
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Shylock?
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
In a box under my seat.
Are they heavy?
Yeah.
Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
It's about time.
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
The world is a dizzying place.
Very well.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
What do you want from me?
At the moment, very little.  Your company at my table...
Hi, our lot!
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
Are you kiddin'?

Come on!
Damn.
What the hell's goin' on?
It happens to this piece of shit...
...all the time.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
 Excuse me...
...-ed.
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
Do you wanna give me a minute?
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
I don't care. They're out.
Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!
Fuck you - fuck you.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
Your mother.
Blockhead started it!
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
Then why are you here?
I knew it.
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
Hear me out...
I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
No... but what choice have we?
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
And the next one...?
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
And the last...?
Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.
She was there...
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
Could you give us a moment.
That was what we were led to believe . . .
A room. I'd like a room, please.
A single room or a double room?
A single. Just for myself, please.
Will you sign the register, please?
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
Well...
I think they're announcing your flight.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Captain, what do you want?
Call me Dudley.
Dudley, what do you want?
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
Yeah, I hate them.
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!
Where are you going?
I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
That must have been pretty special.
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
Damage control!  What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
You ain't actin', mama.
Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
There was a bang.
It was the window.
It's cold.
Tell your mother.
Mom, it's ...
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
Yes.
You on drugs? Huh?
No... I...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Please, if you'd just listen...
Remove him at once.
Sure.
Could you get me Superman's autograph?
We're very lucky.
The funeral's on Friday.
Dead?
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Well done, Mr. Spock.
Any idea who could've done it?
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
Yes.
Yeah......yeah.....
It's so nice.
This really looks like Hawaii here.
Ok...that's it.
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
I don't know, I never met your father.
Maude???!
So, have you given him "some" yet? 
Yeah ... Sort of ...
We'll get you fixed up in no time.
Answer. 
Please tell me.
For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
Colonel.
Mind if I sit down?
I can't keep up.
Last night.
Send him away.
What?
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
Kalen... hold on a minute.
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
What?
Where you lived with them.
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
Jorge.  When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Yes, sir.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Tell me about it.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...
She got off, huh?
They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
No more drugs.  Please...
I have to do this, James.  You're very confused.
Somewhere in Utah.
What's the listing?
D&D Mattress Man.
Thousands.
Why?
Just try it.
I said, no thanks.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
What?
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
What was that?
Anonymous.
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Who's Miss Johnson?
Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
No, I figure once they see the place and we get'em a little drunk, they'll all want to help. We should have that floor done in a day or so.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
No applause!
For what.
For everything.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
Insane.
To make a long story short...
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
Excuse me.
I'm here.
I know a lot of nice girls.
Work, work, work, that's all do
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
Story of my life.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
You mean, outside... with her.
Grant, no!
I loved you. I loved --
Grant, you're sick!
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Shut up.
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
I feel weird asking him.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
No coke tonight.  Right?
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
Baby, I said I'd be there. Really.  Trust me.  Gotta go, honey.  Bye bye.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
What?
Nice dress.
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you?  My father bought this place.  He never walks away from equity.  Why don't <u>you</u> leave?
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
YAAAAAAAA !
My patient had to leave early.
Who was that?
Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
I'm a good friend of hers.
How do I know you're not lying.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Probably.  One of the many.
What?
Nothing.
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
Don't say my name...
I love you, Nick...
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
Hey. There.
...what has she done to harm you...?
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
Exactly. They drank it all.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
Six.
How many wings have they got between them?
Twelve.
How many feet?
Er, well, twelve.
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
How the fuck should I know?
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?]
What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Larry....
Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Try an angel.
An angel?
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
Well you can't blame them in a way.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
I know...I know.
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
Why don't you go to the police?
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
Let's not get too idealistic.
Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
Where are my goddamn books?
Books?
My journals! Where are they?
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
He'll show up one day.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
Is she a Capulet?
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
That's easy. Me.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
On his back, I suppose.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
You're too good to me.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
No - not yet.
And I never will- you know what's between us  we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Get it out of here!
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
That's easy. Me.
I thought - is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
On his back, I suppose.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
You're too good to me.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
No  not yet.
And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Clo-Clo?
I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens 
It won't happen again.
That's terrible news...
I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
You're begging him to kill you?
If he thinks he's man enough.
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
I plan to live one hundred years!
No you don't.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
Honor, I suppose.
What a handsome word.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
No.
Is he gonna be okay?
Mom.
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
They're all human beings
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
Stop, please! I don't know!
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?
Hear the details.
I can tell you very little. He was run over by a car. He was dead when I arrived.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
Arline?
The wire is ten years outa date.
That's why he won't know it.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
I think so.
Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
It's good exercise, Mom.
Why not?
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Veronica!
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
We need a car.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Mom--I'm not--
And you wanted him to make a list!
... and taxi fare for me.
Get lost.
I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Yes...
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
I would do it again in a minute.
I'd double it and add 20.
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Ah, I see.
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
I'm not sure.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Well, I didn't but...
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
I'm willing to take that risk.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
You're --
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
I disagree.
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
I'm afraid of nothing.
Will you shut up!
Helm ready, sir.
Thank you.
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Sure. No problem.
Could we try it now?
Absolutely.
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Yes Sir!
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
Right.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.
What?  Oh yes.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
Really?
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Thank you.
Is there anything I can help you with?
No, just enjoying the view.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
So I've been told.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
How well did, er, do you know him?
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
What do you mean, maniacs?
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
Nothing.
Relax.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Freddie?
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Too late --
Right over there.
Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
Good.
Thank you.
You have something for me?
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
But Richard, no, I, I --
-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony.
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
Then come find me.
Harry, what --
Get up.
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
No, I'm just going to head home.
Okay.
Huh... 500 meters?
130... 140...
How can you say it?
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
What, for example?
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
Call me Vince.
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
So the method of death is the only connection?
No.  There's more.  There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
I'm sorry.
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
It takes time to process --
No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
Hmm-mmmm.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
Sure he will.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
And, what about us?
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
I didn't leave you.
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
Weird they didn't chase us.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my --
Must be.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Are you done?
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy.  We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end.  Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Isn't he dead?
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
OUR picture?
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
Oh.
But... the silverware?
I use it... to fight evil.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
It is?
I always knew that you were special.
You did?
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
You have no time.  What is your question?
I'm thinking!
You have no time.
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
You are such a wet.
A what?
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Don't start with me again.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
Buffy...
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Oh, fuck you!
You could go and open the door.
Listen 
Whattaya think you're in now?
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Huh?
A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
Do it now!
No.  Now is the time for discipline. Some lessons in obedience for the future Baroness.
Over here!
It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
I, uh.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
What? What do you mean you --
Sue... look at your hands.
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Have I done the right thing?
Aye, sir.
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
What?
What are you doing down there?
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
...lost the screw...
You got a paperclip?
He.  Well, he...
Where can I find him?
The Peter Pan.
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Speed?
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Madmartigan.
Who is he?
I don't know much about him.
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
But Superman isn't an average man.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
My point exactly.
What?
He says it's a bad idea!
What's a bad idea?
Okay.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Right.
Unless you want the right.
No, you take the right.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
Okay.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
Good idea.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
Right.
Slink!  Hang on!
You did what?
Not too sure about that.
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
He won't be; I swear to you be my children he won't be.  Just keep an open mind when we talk.  I hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to talk business with him.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Yes sir, I did.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
No sir he didn't.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
And what did they say about me?
They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.
Ask me a question.
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
How was the class?
Yeah, she's comin' up.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
There's always a surprise.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Feeling old?
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
Jimmy, stay with me.
Out.
When they coming in?
Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
Not necessarily.
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
Who are you trying to convince?
Yes, ma'am!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Sorry!
What!? I'm not going down there again!
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
What's the delay?
About thirty seconds.
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
No matter what the British government says, I won't kill this story.  Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator... And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later.
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
Naw. That's over with.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Yes.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
Correct.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You haven't heard me yet.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
We'll find out now, won't we?
Losing power. The laser drained it.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
Just a thought.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
You don't even know these guys.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
Let's see how we get along.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
You love him, don't you?
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
Who prescribes the brandy?
A lot of works.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Cynthia!
What!?
Why did you do that?
Because I wanted to.
But why did you want to?
I wanted him to see me.
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
He wouldn't do that.
You don't know that for sure.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
Did he touch you?
No, but I did.
You touched him?
I'm here.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
I have a rough idea.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn write-off.
I tried to show you something beautiful.  Something about all of US 
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
This ain't no cop.
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
That part of me is dead.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
But Kirk...
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
Kirk. They're gone.
... Gone?!
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
... Damn!
What?
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
The caramel thing is my pick-up line.
Fergus.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
Well... Well... Okay.
Your sex life?
Your existence.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
Over the gold.
Maybe it was more than that.
But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
Fine.
What?
Will you think about it?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
Vulcans sleep lying down...
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
Joe?
Raise them --
I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
See you then . . . doctor.
What do you make of this?
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
Suit yourself.
What?
I think what you did...
What?
... was so romantic.
Eddie.
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
He's losing his teeth.
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
No. Yes?
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
Which you have in mind.
He stole another contract.
Whiskey.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
You are ready, then?
Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.
...here comes the...
...tunnel!
Tunnel.
You did? Just now?
No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
Okay.
Come on...
I'm really glad you two found each other.
Yeah.
Ten seconds....
Yeah.
At least four hours.
You do.
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
That machine --
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
How long ago?
More than 800,000 years.
"Then they'd put you in jail."
So what the hell's the good news?
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
I'll supervise.
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
Anything interesting.
I finished it.
Good for you.
Michael's.
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.
Yeah.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
All right, what happened to me?
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
I came home that night and there was blood on the floor.  Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself.  They were acting nervous.  And that Stens kept going under the house.
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
What is it?
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
Really?  You're the best.
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
We weren't sure we could trust you.
You're right.
Nothing worse than a common tool.
Rowan...
Harder...
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
Yessss...
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
I'm out, Johnny.
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it.
Where?
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
Do you remember his exact words?
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Are you still in touch?
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
Which one?
Which one?
Which clinic?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Bring me forty-five back.
Naturally, Comrade.
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Oh, no.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Don't say that.
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
Do you think you can handle it?
What? On one hearing only?
I think so, Sire, yes.
Sure.
Phasing? To where?
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
Jim...
Three...
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
I don't know. Something's missing.
Where?
Right here. A minute ago.
That's nice.
San is an honorable title.
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
I'm not gonna leave you!
Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
Yes ...
Did she do that to you, too?
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Neat.
Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
I didn't say when I want to die -
I'm looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
Very well.
Then we'll be safe?
Yeah.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
I... I like you.  A lot.
Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Is that what you were doing...?
Yes...
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Thank you, Clarice.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Dr. Chilton... I believe you know each other?
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
She sure does.
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
At what, exactly?
My van is half full.
So?
So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.
Dad, please.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
You're way ahead of me again?
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
The lesson being?
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
I'm getting so good at this.
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
I'm not talkin' about your damn word, Jerry. Geez, what the heck're you?... Well, look, I don't want to cut you out of the loop, but his here's a good deal.  I assume, if you're not innarested, you won't mind if we move on it independently.
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
No.
I don't anymore.
Can I have some?
Knock yourself out.
What?
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
Say again?
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
Uh-huh.
You don't look alright.
Yeah... cop hit me...
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
Yeah.
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
Mom! It wasn't like that. It was bullsh... They were just harassing us. No charges were filed. It's alright.
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at least twenty guys in there. Let's wake 'em up and get this party on the road.
You alright?
You could make their heads bleed, though.
Yeah... If you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
What--
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
I was bowling--
So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
Ah. Where?
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
So we understand each other?
Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
How goes it, Will?
Wonderful, wonderful.
Burbage says you have a play.
I have. And chinks to show for it.
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
Then how did you know?
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
All right, I'll give it a shot.
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Great, great. I hope you make it.
When is it expected back?
You are in.
So did I....
No way!
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
Cut it out, will ya...
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
The driver will...
But I speak English.
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
I do not speak English.
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
You want this ticket?
Yes.
Then don't be smart.
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
How is it back there?
I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
So speaks the court jester.
Fuck you
I expected more from you.
Sorry to disappoint.
How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
What are you talking about, my tie? What's my tie got to do with anything? I need the tie for my work.
Music?
Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares the hell out of the slopes -- the boys love it.
Your friend was to remain where he was!
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
This isn't any better, Chris.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
They didn't get my contracts.
They--excuse me...
What are you doing?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
Don't say any more.
You goin' back inside?
One thing I need.
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
It belonged to my dad.
Lucky.
So where are you now?
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
Shit.
Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
Just take it.
Yes, very.
And certainly pretty.
Yes.
How long have you known her?
I told you. We met yesterday.
In a bird shop.
Yes.
She was selling birds.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
Mother, where did you go to law school?
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
I know, Mother.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Yes, Mother.
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
I know, Mother.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Mother?
Yes?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
I don't care if I never get home.
Sure. I'd like that.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
I bought him a watch too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
Yeah.
At the most, which is impossible for him.
Zero's a number right?
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
How many zeros was your wife worth?
I forgot she's in here.
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on...
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
Two o'clock.
Where's my dress? I have to go home.
Yes Mother.
Why?
In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
Your Majesty.
What do you love so much?
Your Majesty
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
That's right. When?
Would you like to come out tonight?
What time?
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
I shivved him.
How serious is it?
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
Calm down --
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
What?
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
What's he doing there? Teaching?
No, he's working on another book.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
I didn't know that.
Ten maybe twelve years ago, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly lasted for months. I heard it damn near killed him.
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
Yes.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
No.
Maybe youre not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldnt need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if thats what its gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids college fund.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
In the Winnebago.
In other words, no.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Can you isolate the wave?
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Certainly.  Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
H-how do I get...?
Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to your right...
No.  At dawn.
Why?
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
Here.
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
Yeah... that's all it is.
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
No.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
Very well.
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Why not?
I've told you.
But I don't understand --
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else.
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Yes.
Unbelievable.
Seven it is.
I'll think about it.
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
Are they...?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three.  Are your parents home?
Was Mom an adjustment?
I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
Like it were a piano?
It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.
Not really.
Hey!
Wha'?
Well...uh...
Shame on you!
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
Strip?
Yes, slowly.
It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
No, she'd stashed it by then.
--what?--
...you're money...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
Now go over there and get those digits.
You're money.
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
Nothing.
Someone's back there.
Hey! Come out here!
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
Don't talk to me like that.
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
No.
Jealous much?
I just played it.
Play it again.
But that was the fourth straight time.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
"Liebestraum."
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "Liebestraum."
What sort have you got?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
Yeah.
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
Yes... Good, good...
So, what are you looking for?
What about an untrained pup, white...
How much of a hurry are you in?
Tomorrow?
Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
I see. How much?
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
... Fine. Ill go for the safe place.
Have the money ready by 11am. Well call you.
Yes...
Thought so.
He's not coming.
Not coming? What happened?
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Sometime?
Yeah, like maybe never.
But what are you going to do?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Dartmouth?!
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
What, hon?
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Goodbye.
He's thirty-five years old.
You're a great architect, Albert.
Thank you.
Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --
Bird. That's jazz.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
To the shark.
Of course not.
It would just be helpful to know.
No.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
I'm just preoccupied.
Do you like my new look?
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Really?
Sure. Of course.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
That's great.
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good.
What for?
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
Why?
You're right. We should sit in silence.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Best time for banal chit-chat.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
What are we like in...1998?
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
You really wanna know?
Yeah, you betcha.
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
Wow.
Jezhush.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
The what?
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
The whale's mouth?
The Shark's mouth.
What shark?
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
Cattle ranch!
I'm not kidding.  You can get one if you have the credit.  Look just like real cows, too.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
Merry Christmas.
I'll only be a minute.
You've already been fifteen.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
How old is Jeb?
Four.
No.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
I wonder how they put all those pieces together?
Come away, Amy.
Kid, get outta the way!!
NOOO!!
Great.
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
And she did it all for me.  For love.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
She wants to kill you.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
I'm already walking. Where is it?
Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
Yes, sir.
Passion...
Boom!!! Boom!!!
...Yes.
Without me.
Showdown.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Dick, we need some time apart --
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Dick...
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
No?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
What night?
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
You want his name?
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
I know; this a long way from Watts.  But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing.  Just peace and quiet.  Listen.
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
Ten thousand sounds high.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
Good idea.  Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
He's a friend.  He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation.  He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive.  We didn't know what else to do.  It wasn't my pot.
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
Let's try this way.
Poor fucker my ass...
You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Tell us about it.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
I can see the attraction.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Like this place?
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
Not our problem.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
Not our problem.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
This guy's not a murderer.
If he is, half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack-asses.
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
No, sir.
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
So why are you talking to him?
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
It doesn't help him.
Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
Go away.
What did I do wrong?
Don't be silly?
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
You and I will guard the fire.
What else is left for a man without friends.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
So you killed them?
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I think I see it pretty well.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Same one you had yesterday?
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Hello?
Kim-Lo?
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Wrong number  Nooooooo!
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
Tough day?
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
What do I do then?
Well did you like it?
Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Fine.
You can?
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
Good.  He's up next.
Only.  If he wants to.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.
Don't though. 
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
I killed him!  I killed him!
... Yes sir - elevator!
You can't blame me for trying.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
I am telling the truth.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
What's that?
God, I hate that bitch.
Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
I out rank you, that's why.
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
-- to fight?  We'll see...
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
I'm sorry.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
You believe that?
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
Well, not me personally.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
That's what soldiers do, right?
Maybe in Sonora.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Get a stenographer.
-- not yet --
-- it's just him? --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
-- hang on --
No.
Well, I think if you take several lines out of context, Star Wars becomes a very sexual movie. I mean listen to this.  "Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time ?" or "You came in that thing ? You're braver than I thought".
Kind of.
Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in.
I very much doubt that he will.
Oh...?
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
I see.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Dorsia is...fine.
What were you doing in my room?
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
Thank you.
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
And to history.
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
A mark, huh?
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
From?
Are you from up there? Space?
Space?
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
Eight times.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
But... I had a five...
You're hitting for MY cards!
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
Yes -- quite easy.
Peter.
What?
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
I do like you, Sheila.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
<u>Why</u>?
I'm not sure.
But you suspect.
You will know, in good time.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Right now?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Yes ma'am.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Okay.
Some people prefer it.
No... it's wrong.
What's the code?
Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know.  If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead...  Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract.
I'll be right back.
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Didn't I say that?
Yes and no ...
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I'll mention it upstairs.
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
Too many times.
They ever love you back?
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
It beets being on the mainland.
We have the urn.
No.
I'm so glad we agree.
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
Sheet!
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
Yeah.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
I can't.
Right here!
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
What the fuck are you doing?
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
No.
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
Because they're coming right at us.
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
No. Why should Rose be in my room?
Let's get you out.
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
Do you have any pictures if her?
I've got something better.
Throw him out.
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
You sure did...
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here. I've brought shame to the house of Della Rocco.
Yes, I understand.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
No.
Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
I know that.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
No.
Can I give you my testimony?
You can do anything you want.  Hop in.
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
Wrong number.
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
Invite everybody!  Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents!  Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is?
It'll just be me.
Student?
No.  You said three-fifty?
Plus first and last month deposit.
Will you lease month-to-month?
Not for three-fifty.
How about for five hundred?
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
Back to the land of grownups.
...Huh?
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
I don't care.
How senior?
You asking me to disclose my source?
Good day.
Please, come in, so cold.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
Thank you.
Where's the Sphere?
Please. Why not?
Because it was a lie.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
Elly...
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
What? What's this?
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I met him in New York.
Marge! You've got to hear this!
I...I have no idea, sir.
Okay, son.
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
You're trusting.
Why do you say that?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Ooh! Can we?!
Really?
I was kidding.
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Typically male point of view.
How do you figure?
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
"Be there?"
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
How flattering.
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
Oh, you think so?
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
And I actually date you?
Something wrong?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
I touched a nerve.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
How many?
How many what?
How many girls have you slept with?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
Including you?
It better be up to and including me.
Twelve.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
Including you; yes.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Edie...
Get away from me.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Edie, Edie, I...
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
That's because I never had sex with him!
You sucked his dick!
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
Please calm down.
How many?
Dante...
How many dicks have you sucked?!
Let it go...
HOW MANY?
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
This is different. This is important. How many?!
You can't, your orders are specific...
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
Don't... don't do this...
It's done.
Sire, I --
You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
No.
Hi.
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
What -- you want me to retype it?
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni.
Hey, Ray...
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Thank you, sir.
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
No.
Excuse me.
No...
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
DAD!
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
That's right.  I don't.
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
I'd be honored.
Only that?
And charmed, of course.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Do I not please you, Jack?
In every way.
And am I not fair?
Wondrously so.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
That was in jest.
Jest with me then.
How so?
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
And sweet?
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
Is it me?
No, you were fine.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
You're butting in.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
Come on.
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
He must still be in there.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
You did?
Carter  bank examiner.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Yeah, very funny.
Well . . .  . . . now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
Match it!
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Enough, MacReady!
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
Thelma kinda took to him.
It's only ten o'clock.
Jonah!
Okay.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
No, no.
So will you?
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
American literature. What else?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Not an easy book.
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
Why?
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
No.  I shall be out walking.
We wouldn't have met at all.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You've had dealings with the police before?
Who hasn't--one way or another?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
Is it a crime?
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
You were there when I last saw him.
I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
Fuck you!  Let go of me!
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
Thank you.
This was my very first slow dance.
Perhaps.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
Really?
Or just Hell-adjacent...
Good night.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Good.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
Good.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I think I'll read a little.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
Why do you say that?
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
I went for a walk.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
What's so special about him?
Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
I think it's a fucking good idea.
Amen.
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
And the head?
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Nothing you're willing to do.
Good thing.
I'm working on it.
Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
Let me see it.
No. Wait here.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Nope.  No problems up the road.
Welcome.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Romeo, come forth.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
How do you do.
My brother, Tom Hagen.
What do ya mean?
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
No, not a thing.
Yes, the rum is gone.
See what?
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
They aren't as watchful as you.
Too busy looking after themselves.
The greasy pole.
No loyalty.
No love.
Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
Let him trust Quintus.
Quintus is overly idealistic.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
Oh my God, the sitter.
Of course I like children.
You've never even been around one.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Yeah.
Okay...  Night, baby.
George?
What!
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Okay, baby. Okay...
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
Still looking.
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Why?
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you?  A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Yes.  It was, actually.
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
Laura.
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
Mitch.
So I was replaced by Mitch?
No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
Could I stop you?
You don't drink like you used to.
That's not a question.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Still not a question.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
You think too much?
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
Why?
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
I just don't want to freak him out.
Did Jenny know?
Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
Yes, sir.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
It tastes funny.
He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
I thought you were watching him.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
So what happens now?
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
What about me?
What about you?
Do you think I took some of that money?
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
I got overhead...
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
You're going out?
We're going to bed.
Left you this place.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
erect in sweater, arms folded.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
The police station.
He'll be pulp by now.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
You have no whiskey?
No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul.
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
Let my kid go.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in.
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
They'll have to come right past us.
Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.
What gives?
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Go where?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
Is that right?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
You tell them, Lieutenant.
Of what?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
Go on in.
Two weeks, I guess.
This Kid, what's he like?
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
Positive?
... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.
Forget it-
What are movies about?
Telling stories.
Nope.
Showing life
Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
What kind of people?
People who want to bend the rules...
Half the time he's bluffing.
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
I asked around.
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
Imagine that.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Might I ask why?
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
That is not possible.
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
What do you propose?
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
I can't do that.
Nothing.
Did you hurt her?
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
No! At least I don't think I am!
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
An invitation?
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Sure. We can practice talking.
Okay.
What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
You guys are new?
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
It's nothing personal, though. 
What's the matter?
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
Maybe we are...
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
Don't go over it again, please.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Please.
I don't want to move away.
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
But why can't we stay here?
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
No...
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
I know what you need.
You can't talk to me like --
Like a piece of shit? In my eyes, you are a piece of shit. Think anyone would miss you if I threw you out the window right now? I could say you jumped when I came in. Who are they going to believe? Not you, because you'd be a dead piece of shit.
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
If you want to.
I don't want a mistrial.
What's that?
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.
Again?
Please.
Dad.
Come into the kitchen.  I'm just making your mother's tea.
Alexandretta. Now we know.
Yes. Now we know.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
You think so?
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah.  What's that?
Your only hope.
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
Jah guides us.
Maybe so...
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
I wanted the choice.  The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me.  That's how it should've been.
Your children?
My dolls. We can pretend.
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
What happened?
I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
Thanks.
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Move it!
What do you mean?
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
But Rennie...
I'm not!!
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
I thought you were married!
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
This girl has a child?
We have a daughter.
Tipico.
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
Hey, the poet...
Jack, I --
No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
Yes.
What?
I don't believe it.
What's the matter?
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Yeah ... How'd you know?
Lucky guess.  Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
I thank you.
You're welcome.
What... huh?
Check it out.
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
Oh! My God! 
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
We could, if I'm not in jail.
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
-- In what sense?
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Oh, he did.
What did he do to the uniform?!
I just don't understand what went wrong --
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
Oh no, I couldn't.
It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
Please.  It's my job.
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Like... us?
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
Huh?
I can read it to you.
You mean, again?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Oh. What happens now?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
I'll fill page after page, I promise.
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
What's your first move?
I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
No.  Have you?
Italian.
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
The Stratford.
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Huh?
Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat down with a pencil and added it one day.  But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.  Ah, here's a lost soul.
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
Men like you don't need orders.
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
See me in my office.
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
Why not?
I saw one.
You saw a MiG 21?
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Where did you see that?
It's classified.
That's right.
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Just what is your question?
What color were the original Hebrews?
I told you we don't know for certain.
Then we don't know that God was white.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
In case of what?
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
Yes.  I have to go...
She on the passenger side?
Let's do it.
Good.
God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
At your service, Count.
Now give the signal.
What?
You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this...
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
I have.
And we're going away for a holiday.
For a month.
A month.
Right and don't embellish.
I promise.  I won't.
No, I'm good.
I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
Just drunk enough.
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
Sure.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
Sounds great, Swanney.
Yeah.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
Sure will, pal, sure will.
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
And we're very grateful.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
An offense --
An indictable offense.
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
True enough.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
Same.
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
No.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
I'm sure that's true.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
Excuse me.
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
You don't love me.
Stop.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
That's one way to look at it.
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
Oh--a hundred times--
--and I can tell you where to get off.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Will you leave me alone?
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
Baloney!
No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Really? No kidding?
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
Better than starving to death.
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
But what they done, they...
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
I'm a professional killer.
That's good.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
When does the bus leave?
In about fifteen minutes.
Thank you.
I do, please.
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
It's sugarless.
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
So why'd you give up ball?
Why do you keep asking me that?
Cause I don't get it.
Something was just missing.
What?
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
No.
Wait'll you see!
On all what?
On Furtwngler.
I don't know.
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
Oh yeah...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
Not really...
Forget it, I can't explain it...
Do the books!  Do the books!
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Thanks very much.
And a *lot* of paper!
Hundreds of times.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
No.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
I suspected that he -- well.
What?
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
About Charles...
Go live in a tent.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
 
What?
It's working.



We got-...
...-ta get outta here!
 Vitelli! Vitelli!

Can we get out on your end of the tunnel?
We never had any. What's the problem?
Don't hurt my ear again!
You okay?
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
What's going on?
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
Your Royal Highness.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
... Just give me time to think...
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Everyone remember where we parked.
...Long.
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...time to time, yeah.
Not tonight...
...though.

Odd, then, that his car...
...should be right outside.
Like I say, Doc Long's...
What was that all about?
I have connections.
Where?  What?
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
But that's cheating!
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
Yeah.
Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.  Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
Now stop it!
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Trust me to get the missionary.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
Phillippe.  Rest now.
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
What room?
Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
What do you mean?
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
What did Tommy say?
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
Yeah, I know.
Sure...
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
You have beautiful eyes.
Jim was old enough...
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Yeah.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
That's meat.
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Steve...
Steve's going to explain it.
Wendigo?
Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And if one touches you...
And this?
Good night, Alex.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
The DMZ?
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
What hours do you work?
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
You must be rich.
It keeps ya busy.
You know what you remind me of?
What?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Oh. Who was that again?
The singer?
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
Kris Kristofferson.
Ethan, tell me -
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
Yeah.  Some of it was fun.
Wasn't no bullet.
Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
Sean --
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
This is my house.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
Why am I calling you?  You're my father.  I'm not supposed to call you?  What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
Very much.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
My life is a living hell.
Yes, David...
Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
An anti-psychotic...
It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the number...hello...hello...
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
Go away.
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Shut up.
Maybe I was wrong about you.
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
Hey!
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
We're not all frigid.
One more round.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
...Stop jivin'!
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
...Thanks.
I need a drink.
You haven't been by lately.
Again?
Do you have any friends, man?
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
This doesn't go upstairs.
You have to! Quickly!
...imagine a better grape for the region.
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
Sure.
Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
Its okay, Alan. I get it. Im in your shoes, Im thinking exactly the same thing...but heres the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, its all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell theyre gonna send their kids to college.  Its just people...
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
What happens then?
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
LaMagra --
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
What?
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
Making a living.
Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension?  Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like.
Sit down, Lombardo.
Who knows? Fog, night...
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
Oh... Alright, back you go.
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Waiter! Check, please!
She finds him "personable."
Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
No wonder he was angry.
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
We're being exterminated.
That's it?
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
Dr. Satan?
Eventual supernova.
But this is absurd!
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
He's a pretty good actor, though.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
I have to go, Julian.
Why? Why do you have to go?
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
It's your best play, Nicky.
They'll lose because they're my team.
He will absolutely hate it.
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Where?
Just around the corner.
How will I know you?
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
What about back home?
No.
Yeah.  I think so.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
What happens at eleven o'clock?
When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
I have a place for that.
I forgot my chemistry book.
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
No. You were there.
You've killed women?
Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!
Why?
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Well I want to leave.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
And?
And I--we--want some Black people up.
Did you ask Sal?
Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's.  He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall.
Laugh it up.
Right. Claims assessor.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
They said I was dogged?
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Like this bandleader.
Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtwngler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
Yeah, would of been nice to of knowed him, the way you talk about him.
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
Then -
But so is Vond-El
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Oh, sorry, right.
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
Where is she?
Up in the room.
No, just one.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
It would not be the same without you.
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.
Negative.
Sir.
What about?
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
Why don't you see Lester?
Your husband?
Yes.
What about?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
You're not finished here?
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
I'd better go see how he's doing.
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
But Sean said...
I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
And the rest of 'em?
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I can't imagine any place better than here.
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
I forgot my glasses.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
Harrington.
I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if
Of course.  Of course.
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
Did he bring that with him?
Not now, Wendy.
This isn't about "doing it." I just think we need to talk some things out privately before...
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.
Thank you, Dad.
You sure you know where to find one?
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
And what does that mean?
Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
Well, we could delete it.
One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
But not more than your comfort.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
That's a lie!
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
I'd throw everything away for you.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
I gave her my word, Warner.
That's fine, Stan.
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
Ah... The giants.
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
Oh, Betty --
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
No... what about your sister?
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
The present situation?
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
You know about the United Nations?
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
He's not, he's...
That son of a bitch.
Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
Shut the fuck up.
Sure.
Do you like pink?
Very much.
Where do you hail from?
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
I am a man.  And now I've found the brightest star of all.
Who?
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Fine.  Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
We've lost Bridge control!
Emergency override!
Nothing.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.
I was just scared is all.
No.  It was mondo bizarro.
I hope so, too.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
Fine.  That's great.
Is that it?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Nice friend.
Yeah.
What's his name?
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there.  Instead of "Sin City."
Who then?
Yeah, how so?
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
There's always a bright side.
I'm listening, sir.
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
I ran into complications.
I hate to say it...
Then don't.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
We're gone.
Bandit?
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
No you weren't.
Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is"  No, do you really?
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof"
Mush. Mush.
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
Send it collect.
Collect?
Collect.
Not so bad.
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
No, it hasn't.
Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
But Countess...
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
Yes.
Very well.  Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do you feel about that?
Yes.
Are your parents living?
Why, no.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to
That is what bothers me.
I see.  You don't care about life anymore.
Nothing.
Four aces, Doc.
Honey.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Muchas gracias.
Sierra del fuego.
Got it.
Did you take your clothes off?
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
No.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
That you love Mary.
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Huh?
You found her.
Better. I found Ryuji.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka.
Osaka?
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
We need to talk.
That's right...
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
That's the truth...
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
Huh.
You don't ax your sales force.
No.
You...
You...
You build it!
That's what I...
You fucking build it!  Men come...
Men come work for you...
You nervous...?
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
I think I've heard of you.
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
It's a party.
Let's mingle a little, shall we?
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir.  Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
I was dreaming.
What were you dreaming about?
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
Oh, yes, that's right.
But it was just mine.
They had all the pieces they needed.
Why don't we talk about it later?
What difference does it make...?
Tell me.
Let it ride for a while.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
That was the general idea.
Come on.
How did you know?!
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
1899.
I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
What are you?
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
To see if he can get away with it.
Will you bring it in to me?
I'd rather not.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Right.
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
Taken.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
That's exactly what I told myself.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
Yeah, but, buddy --
Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
Oh yes he will.
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
Cow tipping?
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
I'll take care of it.
Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
Be seein' you.
Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
What!
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
Girlfriend?
No.
Gay?
No.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
How many weeks?
Just one.
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
That was Beaumont.
Who was Beaumont?
An employee I had to let go.
What did he do?
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah.
So we on the same page then?
I follow.
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Oh, Maya. No.
Yeah.
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
And what if I run into one of those things?
Why doesn't it never work out?
What?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
No.
Maybe I can help.
It's gone to the top.
How high is that?
The numbers stop at 107.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
You know. The finger.
Did you really ask?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
Dance? Here?
Why not?
They know you here--know your name.
I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
You bit my finger.
If I weren't married?
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
-- my --
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
Everything is wrong.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
No.
Are you in trouble with the law?
No.
Am I getting warm?
Sid, how are they hanging?
Down around my ankles.
It's not your fault, Dad.
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
No.
Anna.
How's it goin', Coog?
Toward the Pole!
I net a guy in a bar.
Suicide is a private thing.
Ed Smythe, yes.
Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? 
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
Man, it's already ten thirty.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
Yeah, that's true.
What?
They made ARCADE.  It's still a game, right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
And after all, you have such morals.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...
Yeah?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Why?
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
How much time?
Time.
What time is it now?
Twenty-after-ten.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
I ain't no preacher anymore.
All right, you remember the *man* then.
What picture?
I'm talking about you.
Me?
Yeah, you.
oh dear.
What happened?!!!
Ahm.... .
Over there man.
You got the job.
-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
Movies?
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
Well, sit down.
Oh, Jesus.
You all right?
I don't know, I mean, I-
You wanna lie down?
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
How about a ginger ale?
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
Later.
But it's only for thirty seconds!
Call Wydell.
I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
That obvious, huh?
Then you saw him, too?
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
You called the doctor, huh?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh - I'll get it!
Oh! Oh!
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
I know. That's why I went.
But then you told her you were home.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
Next time, have some good news.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
The letter he sent.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
He...he could have been watching us.
Hey. This is Shelly.
Hey, Shelly. 
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
What did you do then?
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
What happened with the tape?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
You wanna watch this or what?!
C'mon!
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
I - I'd really rather not...
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
I don't think so...
PLEASE? We have to!
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
You buy any of this, Blair?
Is that good or bad?
It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
Ok...
I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
Nah, it'll work.  Where's Bela?
We won't breathe a word.
You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
You've got a private office here, haven't you?
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
I'm not FBI anymore.
You never were...
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
Why not.
Are you?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
How'd you find that out?
He told me last night.
He called you?
He came by.
What?... What'd you do?
We talked.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
I don't know.
You think so, Frankie?
Hell, you got steady work.
What're you going to do, Charlie?
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Violet, please!
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
All right, Caesar.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Why the south latrine?
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.  Remember.  There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders.
No bullshit.
Well... sure...
Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
Even simple.
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Barton!
I want to know!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Hah!
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
I'll bet. Jesus  "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
I could take it or leave it.
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're real good.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Yah, ya think?
A long time.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Nothin' much.
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
I need to see you, Jake.
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
I need to see you.
I am, as a matter of fact.
Hello.
I'm Opal.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi.
Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
You feign ignorance?
WHAT HAPPENED?
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
He'll survive.
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
I understand that, sir.
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
No, sir!
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
What about all the gear?
Well, I don't know....
I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
You've nothing to apologize for.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
Not at all, I enjoyed --
Now, we go -
Where?
Over there by the bar.
I want my lawyer!
They're at the beach....
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
You give me a pain!
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
And they never proved anything against him.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
Nope, I'm through!
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!
Because I was standing next to him.
What kept you?
The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
I'm fine.
You sure?
I'm fine.
You don't seem fine.
What?
I wasn't expecting this.  I need to think.
A bad insurance risk?
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
A cemetery?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Gin.
Shit...
Help me.
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, ma'am...
You were screaming like crazy.
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
All right, let's go.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
That was my first question.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
Yes -- that is true.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
Would you care to be more specific?
What I have to say must be said to all concerned.  It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
From the Other Place...
Nope, there!  That's one.
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Yes, sir--
I can't make it out?
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise.  Dragons be deaf as tree stumps.
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
Michael...
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
You're not my father!
Then why do you come to me?
Because I need MONEY!
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
Not so fast.  Who's that?
He's company.
Bad company...
What do you mean?
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Casharoonie!
Sam, if she's here...
Oh...
Dad!
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
Who's Kathy?
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this.  Sorry. Go ahead.
I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
Look at this finger here.
I'll help ya.
Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too much trouble.
You said it.
Command me, lord.
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
Kahn?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
Sit.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Shut up.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
What's its current position?
You are so mean.
Is *what* getting me down?
Where's Daddy?
What's the problem?
I have to see my father.
Of course. There's no need to shout.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
You don't like cheats, do you.
That's perfect!
All I need--
Yeah.
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
As opposed to?
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Yes.
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
I noticed.
Yeah, but for who?							*
He could be working her to get to you.
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
Anyway.  He walks up to her on lunch yard today.  And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
Saddle River, New York!
It's in New Jersey.
New York.
I think it's in New Jersey.
It's in New York.
Oh, I didn't know that.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
If you got a good one, Wick...
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
I agree.
That bitch? No.
In my time, and nobody else's.
I think I had some when I was eight.
Did you like it?
I think so, why?
Go on. Tell me more about her.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
I'll make the soap myself.
But the rest is right.
Will she be dark or fair?
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
No...not yet...
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
That's okay.
What's okay?
Just a manner of speaking.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
-- We must do something...
Yes, the police must be called.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
Yes, I know them --
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
We must call the police, your excellency.
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up.
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
Where is this happening?
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
Yup.
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
We don't hang them at home, y'know  just in the streets..
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Who said that?
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?
Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
I looked like an Italian man!
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
I thought you'd never ask.
I swear it will be done.
Okay.
'Film Producer seeks young men, 18 to 25, for hardcore film. Prior film experience a must. Call Jake at Players Motel. 777 Vine. 463-5671.
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
Thanks, buddy.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
Well... I'm still...
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
We can take your car.
It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
It's freezing.
I'm not cold.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
It's not healthy with it closed.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.
I don't want a mistrial.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Go where, Ray?
Back to New York for starters.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Don't make me take them away from you.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
That's what Josh and Mike said.
Shut-up.
It's starting to let go!
That's good -- you're doing fine.
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
I thought it might be.  From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam.  Force me to testify in court.  He came by the garage this afternoon.  Gave me this piece of paper.
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Greetings King Arthur.
You know my name?
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Quite.
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
There's a carriage house around back.
Am I too heavy for you?
Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
We'll see.
He's drunk.
What the hell are you doing?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
I am Gale Weathers!
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
None.
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
That's funny.
I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
Inside, Vince.
Would you desert your friends?
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Take it easy!
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
You have rope?
I am too old to climb down a rope.
You won't have to.
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Do you want a tablet?
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Then don't come.
Okay, sure.
You're not dying.
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
One-four degrees...
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
Ben.  Are you okay?
Am <u>I</u> okay?!  You wanna explain that?!
"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
You're hung up again.
I am not!
Sit down? What are . . .
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Well, naturally. Of course.
Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Thanks.
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
I don't want it now.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
What happened?
You did.
Who?
Local?
No.  She just moved here last month from Portland.
No, you keep one.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
--You never had a camera in my head.
The Building and what?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
They went out of business years ago.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
It's yours.
I could.
"Madam!"
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
"Madam!"
By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!"
He heard everything we were saying.

Three-one-zero, aye!
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
He stole a tractor.
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
No onions?
They make you fart.
Would you like to sit on my lap?
No thank you.
Are you sure?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
Perhaps. 
Sir, yes, sir!
The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
Dad!
What?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
You think I'm fake.
Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
You disrespect our tradition.
Boss, we got our own tradition. We call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
Certainly, Herr Director.
Sedate her.
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
Yes.
What would you call it?
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
U-huh.
In fact it's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs.  A completely successful fabrication of the past, the Ploughman's Lunch was.
She will be at the ball.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
Anyway, I guessed it right and won these.
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
Dammit youre persistent.  I dont want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
Okay.
Make sure he gets those shots.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Let's forget that we ever met.
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
As a representative of Moscow...
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
You know I want to...
Then do it through my lawyer!
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
God DAMMIT.
I think she liked me.
Did she talk about me?
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
You bet.
You don't act like it?
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
I know it well.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
They do not have your connections.
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
Oh, wonderful!
Well, it's a complicated issue--
Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
Who's there?
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
What?
It's a surprise.
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
You got the Extender?
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true.
Yes ma'am.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
I miss her.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
Ya think?
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
Fine. But what would I do at night?
Be here. In case.
In case of what?
In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything.  Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
I don't know what you mean.
I still don't see you.
We're waiting for the light to cross the highway.  It just changed.  We're in a grey van.  It reads "<u>Noble Carpet Cleaners</u>."
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Simulated space walking.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
Ain't it the truth.
Gaiijin.
I'll check it out.
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
Okay, "mom."
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Your hair's different.
Everything's different.
Are you drunk?
No. Are you drunk?
No. But I have a hangover.
Where's pop?
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
Plannin' on getting married?
No.
'Don't sound so sure.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
The others, sir?
Beth and Harry?
They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
You don't have a choice.
Mom...please.
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
Great stars have great pride.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
Thanks. 
What time did you get to bed last night?
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
You work too hard, you know that?
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Come on, just a little hint.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
The inspiration.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
No way.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
The end.
No, not the end. The beginning.  His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's looking into a mirror, that he's looking at himself. There he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets down on all fours, looks right into the dead man's face, and realizes that he's looking at his father.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
It wasn't like that.
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
That's just the way we like it.
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
It's good.
Oh
The title won't do.
Ah
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
Thank you, Ned.
Have him walk in backwards.
I won't leave you here.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
DeJesus...It's got him.
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard.  Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero.  People watching you all the time.  Waiting for you to make...  a slip.  Slip up.
Probably.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
I don't think the dead much care.
Are you sure?
Are you a believer, then?
How 'bout the morgue?
No.  I have one more thing to do.
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
What about you, you got a crew already?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Okay. 
Catch ya' later.
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Yeah --
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
You damn well better...
You're supposed to be dead!
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Why can't I go out there with you?
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Just wait here?
Contemplate your... panic button.
No...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
I don't take orders at all.
This time, make an exception.
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
I used it to start the fire --
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
How can you say that to me?
Sorry.  I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse.  This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job.  I have a week to get to my job.  Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Not these guys.
Yeah, those guys too.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
But then how can you...
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
How far kin you see?
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
Who told you that?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
She wasn't so bad.
Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
I told your brother I couldn't be his accomplice.  I can't be yours either, Susie, and encourage him to go on pulverizing you.  I know what type - he's my old man all over again!
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
We only live a few blocks apart.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
I don't believe it!
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
I just - hate it when they're - finished.
No, but--
Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
Right.
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
Yes, but George . . .
They're still in the house.
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT!  YOU'RE OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY. GOT THAT?  NOW -- WHAT FUCKING VIRUS HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED FUCKING MANIAC?
What the hell are you talking about --
I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
You're in the Nexus.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
What are you talking about?
He's after me.
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
Dad died from a heart attack....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
A man can change his face--but blood is forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.  Intravenous.
Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
We have to find Magneto.
... Nothing.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
That's right, sir.
'Love was... '
That one.
Yeah, I'll try.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
Where do you live?
Of course not.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Really?
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Yes?
Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
How's it going?
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
Uh huh.
Can I join you?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
What?!
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
What are you and Mike going to do?
I'm alone on this...
Oh, baby...
Yeah.
Yeah... Bedtime.
He's fine.
Okay.
What time do you have to be there?
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Hello 
Okay.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Sure.
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
"Arkady"
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
The old lady?
With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there.
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
I know.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
What else do you know?
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
I don't believe Tom's alive.
Put it on.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
But -
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
Come on, Pavel...
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
No.
I can't believe you.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
Look at the treads on those.
What about them?
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
SIN-I-FUL
You have nothing to fear, William.
Whatta you mean?
Mean?
You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?
I'm fine! I'm fine!
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
Give it up! Just give it up.
Don't think I won't.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
I'll be back later.
What?
Will you take me home?
What?
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
Still sweet.
Pedal to the metal...
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
In Angola. Yeah.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
Danny, it's not what you think.
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
Really?
What?
Frisk me, baby. Give me a real pat down.
No, the slime is rising.
You got a better idea?
Yeah. Me.
Hi.
I was hoping you'd say that.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
She doesn't give a shit about him.
You know what would be great?
What?
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
What?
<i>Promise me... you won't tell her... that I never fucked Pat Benatar.</i>
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
That does sound lucky.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
What happened?
I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca!
They get fan letters...
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
No screamin' shit.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Who?
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
If you do anything to my friend...
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
This way!  Come on!
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
I guess not.
That must be him.
Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret?
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
You say that like I don't know that.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
And when did that pass?
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
You come and visit.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
Working, thank you.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Twice.
Steam.
Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it...
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
The Queen of England?
Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First.  Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
Coffee might be nice.
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
King, we've got to be on the streets in...
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
Look, save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
You're the boss.
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
No... let's walk through the city.
All right...
Claudia, you torture yourself.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
You are more beautiful than any of them.
What's in it?
Beauty products.
Whoa!
If you loved me like I loved you?
Poppy, this is not the time!
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
Is that what I think it is?
No, it's a treasure map.
Cool.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
What?
You're it.
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
Oh, I don't mind.
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
Did you hear that?
What's wrong with that?
Hi Telly. Where you been?
A fair number, Ma.
Say your prayers?
Yeah...
Sorry.
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
Ok.
Maybe they will.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Excuse me?
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.
At the gallop!
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
I don't know yet.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
Anyone at home?
I live there. Alone.
Someone is sitting in that window.
My mother.
He's dead.
Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
What was your name again?
Michelle.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Yes.  Seriously.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Whatever you want.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
It certainly was.
That's okay. That's his style.
To run last?
To run late!
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
Right.
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
It does me good to see you.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
Giovanni.
Huh?
That's exactly what you are.
Your eye.
What about it?
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
...A flaw...
...Yes, sort of a birthmark...
No. I can't. Not yet.
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
What?
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
Yeah.
Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
Gieg, Chuck.
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
Whatever.
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
No worries there.  She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
For what?
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
What?
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
I'm serious.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
I don't know they just always need it.
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
From her point of view or mine?
Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
Right.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
No.
Why not?
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
That's what I thought.
Got to talk to the brothers.
Now where were we?
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
All right, where is he?
So, it's obvious, huh?
Is it safe?
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
Not with your hairdresser.
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
Shhh.
Well, there's not much time.
One can't just leave - please.
This way?
Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.  It's still day.
Well, let's hit that party.
They'd frame him.
He's out of prison?
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
He wants to know do I mean that.
Man!
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
I'm thirty-seven.
What?
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
Yeah, right -- whatever.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
Smart girl.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
Captain.
Captain.  Right, forgive me.
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
Oh, I'm very grateful.
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
I'm going to find out.
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
God go with you, sister.
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
But what about this?
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
John thinks I'm so snotty.
You are.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
For what?
Whoa, I just...I just...
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
Just go around him.
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
Or half cocked.
That's what I mean...
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Taking a shower.
You left that guy alone in the room?
Come on in!
That's okay.
It's just a corpse.
I know that.
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
Do you understand me?
No, sir.
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
Yes, sir, I did.
That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.
Well, you could say that murder was part...
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
You just drove by it.
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
Are you offering me a bribe?
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
The truth. I just left you out of it.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
That's a reasonable possibility.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
What's your point?
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
You're the man with the gun.
Naturally.
Naturally.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Only one way to find out.
Sustained.
Francis? Where are you?
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
No. Reba...?
Are you okay...?
I'll see you later. All right?
You'll come by?
Yes.
You bastards!!
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
No, sir --
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
Sir --
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
Who?
Those fucking Mob assholes.
Hello...?
Surprised?
Well... yes.
Miss me?
I...
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
What's the point?  Look at me.
I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Yes, Reverend?
What do you want with those two medical officers?
They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
Yeah.
You tell on me, I tell on you.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
You know about that?
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
I suppose that would be okay.
Yes!
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride.
C'mon.
Like heroin?
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Like love?
Could be. The physical substance of love.
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
But what -- 
No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all.  Okay, boys, I'm ready.
Now that is an interesting proposition.
I should show them an American?
What did you think?
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
I did.
That must have taken you a long time.
Yeah, it did take me a long time.
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
You have one?
What?
I have a better plan.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
I'm sure we've met.
What do I tell your mother?
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
I'd better get back now.
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
Even there?
It would feel so yummy.
Adenoids?
Lumbago.
What?
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Really?
That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.
What have they got that we ain't got?
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
Me, too.
You don't seem very angry right now.
It's Stanley, sir.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
What was it called, sir.
Boogerland!
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Who is she?
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
Come down.
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance.
Oh I been out.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
No.
Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
It is.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
Yeah.
And I love what you're wearin'.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Or flowers.
See ya tomorrow.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Would you want to work with us on this?
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out?
I think that's it.
Yes.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
Oh. Thank you.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
You're late for breakfast.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
What do you love about it?
Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
You remember Alison?
Why not?
It's humiliating.
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
I have not read you your rights.
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
I hereby acknowledge that...
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
Susan!...
It's always John.
Still wants to move out?
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
This kid just wants his freedom.
It's not going to happen.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
Doesn't make it bad advice.
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
You know, dah--
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
That's good.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
Yes, you said.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
No, thanks Dad.
Or a beer.  I've got some in.
Yes, something.
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
M'mm.
What's it say?
"Salutations from the south..."
Maybe ten minutes...  Thats strange.
Spinning backwards?
Stop pressuring me...
It is not.
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
No.
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
I'd really just like to be alone.
They left. I had to go with them.
Why didn't you tell me?
No fucking way.
He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
Get out, get out!
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Awwwww!
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
I'd love to.
Shit.
Unfurl the squares!
No you don't!
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
I can't do it, Ben.
You cannot escape your destiny.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
But I had to help my friends.
What's that?
Denning was wearing a bug.
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
He's the grrrrreatest!
Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
It's the worst job since keymaster.
Mike Reilly.
All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
I figured that out.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
I've been doing my homework.
Just like old times?
Better than old times.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Where did you get them developed?
Assumed name... Houston.
Good.
By eating our food supplies.
I just can't. Okay?
I know, we'll be there soon.
I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
Wait and see... wait and see...
Sure.
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
I want to live for the three days.
It's happening again.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
I'll bring it back.
Erik. You don't understand.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
But you don't realize....
Goodbye, Aud...
It's my mother's piano.
A piano?
Huh? Get what?
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Well?
Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Whyuh
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Dorothy!  Is she here?
Yes...
I've done this.  I've had to do this.
We're looking at it.
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
Trust me on this Kate.  I really dont think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
Yes, your honor.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
Yes.
It's not that nice.
No...
<u>I did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --
Get a job!
Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
And Jonas?
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
Where do you think Jerry is?
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
What do you suggest?
That you come with me.
I don't think so.
No, I was just... How you doing?
Great. Good. Content...
Oh. How come?
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
They're fine... you miss it?
You must be joking.
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
Uh-huh.  Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels.
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
He's already angry, I don't think --
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
You sat and talked until it was light...
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
So, what'd you say to him? "Double down."?
What does <u>that</u> mean?
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
...would you use a small word?
For approval.
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
Yes.
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
Welcome to the human race.  Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people.  Why don't you <u>find</u> them...?
What?
You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
I don't like things that make you cry.
I just want to look ...
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
I'm sure.
Seven o'clock then.
Maybe.
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
It's cold, Daddy!
Here, put my jacket over you.
Yes... I remember...
Now?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Fuck, OK.
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right.
I can't believe it!
Yes.  Later.
What's your name?
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Good to know you, Willy.
Let's take our best shot.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
Can you - ?
Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
No.
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
Marty...
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
--go over your sources again--
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
What for?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Doubt it.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Whoopee.
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Scott's dead. And unless you wanna play follow the leader, shut up and do as you're told.
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She told me.
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
What?
You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
We did our best, Comrade.
I hope so for your sake.  Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
I told you!
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
Yeah?
I'm a damn good shot.  See that hawk up there? I could kill that hawk with one shot.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
Find out who this Renquist it.
How?
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
Leave.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
They'll soon be over.
In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Back in.
You fucking nuts?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
You got that right.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
Fine.
Yeah. Good.
C'mon follow me.
All your money's in Mexico.
Don't you fucking knock?
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
Paul, get out!
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
What do you want with us?
Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
They're just leftovers.
Is it chicken?
I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
I can't help the traffic.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
It will be okay.
*What* will be okay?
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
He's crazy.
No, he's not. You are.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
Fuck you, kid.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Happy for us.
Tree.
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease...
No, I don't.
You tricked me, damn you!
Take it easy.
There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
I never said it was!
Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
I shall wear it in my hair!
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
Oh, please!
The Witch's voice.
He's lying! I am.
I won't be here Sunday.
--we need more charcoal.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?
Yes, I know this song.
You know War?
Who does not know War?  War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
Well, you know me.  The more they've got, the less they're worth.  This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know.  And if it leaks out of here tonight ...
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
Pontificated.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Scottie --
-- and wanted to go on loving you." And I said, "I won't lose you."  But I did.
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
You're right. Only you can do that.
I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
I didn't know that.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
And he invented fire.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Yes.
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
We're from...
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
They wanna talk to you.
About what?
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
For what?
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Why?
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Definitely old.
That's Itchy, alright.  How many y'need?
She's already on a plane back home.
Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
I don't know what you mean.
The hell you don't.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
It wasn't like that.
No?
No.
What was it like?
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
That how you see it?
I know.
Scumbag. What are you doing?
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
He's your cousin?
Check this out, he's from Russia.
No way.
I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
Well...
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
Really? That's remarkable.
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
That's weird.
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
Yes?
And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --
What?
Your memory.
What about it?
It may have been affected.
Oh.
You may not remember things.
What things?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Oh...that's okay.
When you do...
Do what?
When you remember...
Remember what?
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Right.
Who...are you?
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
How do I look?
Fine. You look fine.
Thanks.
Well...
Well what?
We're here.
Here?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Oh.
Don't you want to get out?
Oh....Sure.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
I feel fine.
You'll feel better
I will?
Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
Fine. Suit yourself.  ...Having a good time?
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
Sure thing. See you later.
Yeah.
And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.
We should take a vacation.
All in Norwegian.
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
How much time do you have left on it?
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
A woman?
Hey drop it, okay?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
And that was the end of it?
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
Well you did.
What're you suggesting?
So will you, someday.
Then the devil is white.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I sure met some.
No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men.
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
So I bring some cheese?
It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
Minneapolis.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
What are you doing?
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
He's not coming.
You and me both.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Well, if that's the way you f...
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
Saw who?!
Don't touch me!!
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
I'd consider it a personal favor.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line.
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
No, one forty-two.
That's got two double beds.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
Agreed.
How do you do?
You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction
Walter--
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS!
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
Yeah.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
No.
What you got in mind?
I want to meet Ratan.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
You're talking about real excitement?
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
Who told you about this?
Rucker.
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Well...
Take it or leave it.
Okay.
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
Good.
You dont say.
That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
You want this in black chips.
Sure, that'll be fine.
Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Is that so!
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
Who said you could?  Who asked you to?
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
I haven't gotten it yet.
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
Yeah, yeah...
Jenny?
No, it says Marleen here.
What happened?
Young woman cut herself.
Shall I call the doctor?
I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here?
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. 
We don't -- ?
They booted me out of Washington.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
Why?  What did they do to you?
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
Take my van!
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
Get your links set up!
I wanna patch in from...
...here!
What about these two?
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
Sir.
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
Yes. You look very sick.
The flu.
So she's got a few sniffles.
Doctor's orders.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Only because you want it.
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Yours...?!
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Yeah.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Yeah, I'll do that.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
I have felt it.
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
Our destruction?  Who?
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
He will join us or die, My Master.
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
Yes.  Nick!
You his wife?
Yes.
He's a good guy.  He sent me up the river once.  Hey, Nick!
Don't fuck with me, Ed. Not you, not tonight.
I have nothing more to say.
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
I don't know about that.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
What, I don't know how you mean?
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it?
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Could you hold on a minute, honey?
Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Which one was that?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Oh, yeah.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
What makes you say that?
I could see she likes you.
Yeah, sure.
I'll call her up.
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Exactly.
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
Lowell.
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
Lowell!
What?
I'm with Don on this.
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
You know what. Go.
I know  I shouldn't have told you
No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
What was he like?
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
Well, he must've found some of the answers...
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
Take me away...
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
No!
Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
Why is that?
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
So what should we do, father?
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
I hope not.
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Uh-huh. And?
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
Did you?
No.
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
It's still sick.
Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
I've lost my car.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
Now you're being silly.  We don't need two cars.  We have a car.  And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit.  An Isotta-Fraschini.  Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschinis?  All hand-made.  Cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
You want me to let him in?
Of course, dont be silly.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
For five hundred, what do I get?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
For two hundred?
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
You mentioned information.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
A thousand.
Got it on you?
Got the information on you?
Get it in half an hour.
What's it to you?
Come on. How much?
'Bout five thousand.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
You serious?
Sure am.
And I keep my mouth shut?
That's what I want.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
You got it.
How about twenty thousand?
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
I don't care.
I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you <u>are</u> in the purple family.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
I'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. I see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here..
Oh.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
No problem, sir!
I can't help it.
He's nothing like you.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
We can't wait to be sure.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
-- where's left to go? --
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
What's MOW?
Movie Of The Week.  I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
What would you call him?
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
Really? Well, let it rip.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
-- the sadistic prick --
-- in the act.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Probably not. no. Why?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
You always said I was a bum. Well  not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
You go too far, Benedict.
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
Goodbye, dear.
Can you see it?
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
And why not? My fortune, siphoned away. My reputation, past repair. I've nothing left to lose.  Silence my husband, or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own.
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
Mornin'.
Is this your establishment?
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
....-lene.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
Iced coffee.
I assume you want that to go.
Assumptions are always...
...dangerous.
Quite a getup for jacking...
...deer.
I beg your pardon?
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
I assume you have one.
Assumptions are always dangerous.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
I will I promise.
Okay, get in to bed.
Just like that?
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
How's that been?
It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
What?  What if he brings it with him?
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Do Something!  Stall them!
Later. Go back to sleep.
Where you going?
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Now?!  It's after eleven.
I can't sleep.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
He doubts me.
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
How do I know?
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
No, I don't know.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
Business or personal?
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
Why is everybody giving me crap tonight?
Sure.
Sure.
Heaven?
I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it...
Twenty eight hundred.
Just what you think I mean.
Are you threatening me?
Sort of... Yeah.
Sir?
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Yes sir!
I took the early rounds.
I'll bet.
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
Beats me.
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
You mock my pain!
Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you.
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.
We've met.
What?!
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Well. . . yeah.
All right, get out.  Both of you.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
Sonny kicks ass.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Is that your real name? Really?
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
That's not it.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government.
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
All right.
And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
Jesus lives, Luis.
You ready?
I will be in just a minute.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
Yes, Griff?
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Thank you.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Then what is he doing?
Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
Yeah, I got it.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.
My fault.
You're not hurt, are you?
I don't think so.
I wish you'd make sure.
Why?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Thank you.
Who are you?
Now, really -
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Of course.
What's our pesky friend up to now?
What are you gonna do?
Get inside!
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
Aliens built it.
Aliens?!
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
My God...
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
Deranged. That would be the right word.
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
You don't?
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
Say, listen--
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship.  We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
And that was 28 days ago today.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
What kind of animal?
Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
It was Freddy.
Enough of that crap.
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
It's for your own good.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
A few things came up.  Or went down.
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
Isn't everything?
The date.
What about it?
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
It's 2041...
Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Twenty-five years.
Let her go.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
Tension. It'll go.
Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
Walter, please--
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
Hey. Nice tie.
Don't get too attached.
Okay.  But not water sports.
All the time.
Peter, okay?
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
I love you.
Shari, Ray feels --
We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
Tonight? We can't make it ...
You've got a midnight matinee.
Now, look here, Norm ...
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
What?
You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
Who is it?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
You learned her lessons better than I.
She got me at a more impressionable age.
William Morris!
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
...omigod, no...
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
You're getting warmer!
Relax -- you're gaining.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
What did he ever do to you?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Adele for god sake please lis...
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
Don't try me.
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
No way.
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
Yeah.
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
No?
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
I know that...
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
You're gross.  See that guy?
Which one?
He gives me a total boner!
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
How so?
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
Yes?
The drinking.
I'll be with you.
I don't want to go tonight.
You don't have to.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
Uh, huh.
What?
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
It was too dark, Daddy.
Yeah. We better git back to house now.
Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
And how do you explain that?
The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night 
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
Dad -- can you listen --
I'll give you ten seconds.  He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
What did Gino drink?
Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
I can't go nowhere.
Why?
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
Oh -- all right.
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
It's automatic.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Oh.
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Exactly! Todays my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
Who is this?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
Hang on.  Carefully...
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
Well...
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
I never needed money.
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
I had him in my grasp.
Cheer up.  You may still.
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
He saw everything!
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.
I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
Tomorrow.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Yeah.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
What do you mean?
Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?
I'm... dying.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Something shouldn't be there.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Get him out've here.
That's a start.
So I'm sorry.
Make it up to me, then.
How?
Ask to meet me again.
Will you meet me again?
When?
Whenever. Tonight.
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
Go to lunch, will you...
I want to work today, that's why I came...
The leads come in, I'll let...
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Just go to lunch.
I don't want to go to lunch.
Go to lunch, George.
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Excuse me...
I... accept your proposal!
I'm not just saying it!
Nor I!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
You scare me.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
Jack...
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Interesting theory. Where's the proof?
Goodbye, mother.
Yeah, ain't it swell?
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
I will if you don't.
I see my sister.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it!  Boiling down half a ton of bones...
I could be her.
'Her'.
You said --
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
Oh shit it's my cell!
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
I thought you hardly know her.
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
And you are a fool.
No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
What is it... the secret?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
What the hell does that mean?
Actually... I don't know.
Oh, uh, I resigned.
Can ya dig it?
It's dug.
Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
What it is -- is the truth.
I don't follow.
No Dude.
They shot Donny!
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
See!  They are using drugs.
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of em take a couple seconds...  ...some of em take a lot longer...
I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
Get up.
What?
You're fired. I have new representation.
Who?
Where we headed?
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
Yup, hell of a mission.
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
Really.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
What'd you think?
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
I don't follow.
Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
Okay, I'll call you later.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
What a surprise...
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
I don't drink beer.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
What I want is to help my father.
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
Like the manual says, "Information is...
Alex, what are you doing?
Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.
How is your cold?
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
So I see.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
How come?
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
Oh.
I know your height, your weight and your Social Security number -- you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your appendix out.
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Sure thing. Come on.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
You found my car?!
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
... What??
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
So, what did they say?
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet...
What'd you come out here for?
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
Her fella.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
And he was missing an arm.
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
I don't know what you're talking about?
I think you know.
Maybe you can tell me then.
And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
Seventeen.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Okay.
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
You're pretty.
D.C.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Sure thing.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
What --
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
Tell me -- let me help --
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
I don't need you to "stick."
You want...
I don't know --
...my soul or something. _ 117.
Walk? Naturally I can walk.
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
What do you mean?
The room!
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
What happened to you?
Don't ask.
With what just happened upstairs --
And where exactly does that put your position...?
I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet.  For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
Is something funny?
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
I've met you before.
I don't think so.
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
I'm going to run.
Why tell me?
You know something.
About running, dying what?
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
It's different now. Help me.
How can I?
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
You don't believe in anything?
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
Your father doesn't like me.
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
Why?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
Yes.
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
Now?
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
We don't know that for sure.
Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
A ragione. A ragione. 
Hmm. C'e questa... 
A-fuckin'-men!
What was that?
was saying
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
How could you?! This is just like home!
What's going on?
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
You live here?
For tonight. 
Oh!
Yes -- oh!
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
How is he?
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick.
If you want.
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Are you tired of it?
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Well what do you want to talk about?
Anything. Anything at all.
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Oh my God.
Well?
Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
It won't.
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
What ten thousand pounds?
Let's turn on the radio.
Radio! What is radio?
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...
Birds are not bad!
Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
Be right down.
Vodka tonic.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
Put me down....
They won't fight with me....
Put me down, damnit....
Hey, Sam.
Open late.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
He should pay.
I don't know.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Perfect dozen.
Each egg has to be perfect.
The quest isn't going well?
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
I can't.
What?
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
What is wrong with you?
Don't.
Fuck her too.
But will he be house-trained?
When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his superiors.  Then we get them and they too will give us names.  And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall.
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
Where were you guys?
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
I think you're trying to run before you can walk, Ann.
Those things never work. Never.
Each of us gets a belt.
I won't take 'em. They never work.
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
And...your point?
You got thirty minutes.
INT. U.S. RESEARCH LABORATORY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT.
What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
You know it?
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
I don't remember.
Mordechai!
All you gotta do is get in.
Oh.
Yeah...
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Electra.
Just Electra?
Yeah.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
No.  Just Electra.
'They won't.'
'Believe in yourself and they will. Let me ask you, Lizzie. Look in the mirror? Are you pretty --?'
Dell -- show me that on a screen.
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
As do you.
I don't know.
It was a stupid thing to do.
It was.
Welcome Home.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
Sure.
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
No shark did that to a boat!
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
We hung out last night, remember?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
What?
You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.  You crossed the line, man.
Why know?
Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
No.
Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!
Underneath.  Somewhere.
I'm sure you kept warm.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
You pawned it.
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
A favor?
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
Oh, I'm sorry --
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
Are they really?
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
You're doing everything yourself?
Yeah.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
He was all right to me.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Nicer than most.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Yes.
Though nicer than most?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week?
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
What was bugging Frank?
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
Yeah.
Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
What about that guy this morning?
You mean Shelly?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
I suppose he just wants to watch.
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
Martinis are for squares, man.
I can't remember..
Absolutely.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Fuck, what's his name?
Cheeco.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
I'll show you.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
Blue. This blue.
Jesus.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Who's Wade?
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
What'd ya mean?
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
What?
I need a favor.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
A bit.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
I won't lie.
I don't want you to lie.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
You seem very sure about that.
I'm absolutely positive.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Then why are you here?
Curiosity.
Remember the cat.
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
So what?
So shut up and keep painting..
What time is it?
5:11.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
So am I.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Then why does she act so dumb?
Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll. And neither does smartness. You see --
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Two men left town right after it happened.
You're not telling me something.
Tron...?
Oh, you...
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
You're very macabre.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Yeah.
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
How?
With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
Wait here.
What's the matter?
These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...
She can hold a bit longer.
Why?  'Cause you know him?
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
Jimmy?
What?
Don't go like that.
Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
What have you got, Hildy?
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
To see a man about a thing.
I can do that.
I'm okay. It's okay.
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
We can change our names.
We can live in a hacienda.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
It'd have to be pretty good.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
Up.
And leave me down here???
Make up your mind.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
I talked you into this?
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
Are you coming...?
No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me?
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be psyched.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
Your Honor...!  Your Honor...
National?
Yes. Percy Warner Park'.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
Do it!
I certainly did not.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
I made macaroni.
I'm not hungry.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
Practically no one.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
And the carrying charges?
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
He's just been for a walk.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
Rifle?
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
It seems highly intelligent to me.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
Blue soup?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Sounds quite beautiful.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
Like what?
Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response!
Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
Yeah.
I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.
You're not going to fail me are you?
No, I... uh, didn't know that
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Still clear?
Yep.
We'll let it run awhile
You ever just stand still for a minute?
You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger.  You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I...I can't do that.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
That's not what I mean.
Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
Any time.
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
You didn't think much about that before.
Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Well...
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
You said it looked like a car accident.
What the fuck!
I'll pay for it.
What were you talking about...?
Yyou look terrible.  You're exhausted. You practically live at the goddamn clinic.    Even pregnant women who aren't doctors know that You can't -
Oh Harry...
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.
Nice to meet you.
Good to see ya. Right this way.
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
But...I...400 years?
That's right, now if you could...
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
No.  Find your brother, okay?
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
Where is it?
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
You've been the man in mine.
Sure.
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
Hop in.
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
No!
What's the matter?
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you.
Who's Horace?
My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.
Thank you, Uncle.
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Yes, sir.
Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
It's a stinking world because there's no law and order any more. It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done. It's no world for an old man any more. What sort of a world is it at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there's not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more. The Tramp starts singing again.
Mine, too.
What were they looking for?
Got it Earl.
Okay, out.
You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
You mind?
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
What about her arms?
Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at this...
Susan.  What are you doing?
Run!
...are you Phil...?
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
Is Linda here?
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
These Dogs'll calm down -- you just have to come in --
Lookit. Lookit!
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
No, please, not again.
Lenny, my dispatcher.
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
Nick, the ice is --
Get to the bridge!  HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!
Invitations?
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.
Shut up.
Just trying to be helpful.  It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
Why?
... just, you could look very heavy...
Don't make conversation with me.
What?
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
He doesn't bite.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Baker.
Right.  In there.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
I won't hurt you.
What if I say no?
Then I'll find another ride.
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
I can take care of myself.
Oh, really?
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
Yes.
At college.
Yes.
What was your major?
Why are you asking me all this?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Art.
Art?
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
Not interested.
You weren't dreaming about me.
I was!
No trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...
Always.  Except ...
What 
Don't you wanna go to your room?!
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Do you want me to?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Agreed.
They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I got a feeling you cost more than two bits.
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
Starck, you still showing those readings?
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
I didn't do anything --
If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
Read it. It's a grabber.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - NIGHT.
This is the place.
Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
The Idiot?
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Great, thanks for the tip.
The Idiot.
So you're hot on this stock?
It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
Anything else?
Nothing else.
Just forget about it.
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
You wouldn't be putting me out.
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Kim?
That's your name, isn't it?
You always call me Miss Brewster.
Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
I hurt you?
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
Shopping?
No.
Well... anywhere in particular?
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
I... I...
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
I'm on a break.
Guess again.
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!
Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
No.
What do you figure he done with it?
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
Dunbar.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Buttfucks the cabin?
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
That bugs you too?
Little bit.
Let's go talk to Bill...
Thank you.
And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
It's terrific!
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
Yah.
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
Yah, I guess.
That's terrific.
Who's that?
Macaulay.
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
STEPHANIE?
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
But you call this room the "temple".
Just a nickname.
The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
I know.
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
Maybe cause he's smart.
Smarter than us.
No harm done.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
The mark? Yes.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
You will what?
I will loan you the money.
Play it for us, please.
In progress, Admiral.
Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
Lombardo ever come out here?
Dien Bien Phu?
Exactly.
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
This is it.
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Huh-huh.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Which ones?
All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
I'm sorry to hear that.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
You have a sister in New Orleans.
How do you do, my friend.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
My jewels?!
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
This morning three Soviet agents arrived. I overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier, the jeweler. Your Highness, they are going to sell them!
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
We keep them.
You keep them.
We keep them, in case the people come back.
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
There's a seat over there for you.
What's the idea?
I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind. 
Wife?
Yeah. Come oncome on!
Oh, excuse me.  I was just tryin'you knowto make things pleasant.
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
Has it helped?
Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
Who's your decorator?
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel.
Sure,.
They'll trace it.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
It touched me, don't you see it now?
That's our reserve air.
It's either that or we grow gills.
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
And they loved Bear.
Oh yes.  Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school.  It's like he was their little treasure.  He was such a beautiful boy.  That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
Just what?
Just me, I suppose...  I'm restless.  I can't help it.
For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
Dottore Fanelli...
What about him...?
Thanks.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
How can we be happy?
You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
What?
Glasses.
Just don't shoot me.
It was the other guy who busted me.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
What if I do?
That's wise, Tommy.
All right, then. I like to be wise.
Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
You owe me for two weeks.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Why don't you try?
A heart --
I have to answer him.
So you can give us away?
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
No one follows that midrash.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
Do we shake hands?
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?
Why?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Where's that airlines bag?
Lord, you're stubborn.
I sure am. Get it.
Cover...our footsteps...
What?!
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
Can't hear you.
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
And you believe it?
Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
She <u>likes</u> me.  She said for me to call!
Why not just go now?
Okay.
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
No, I didn't know that.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
No.
Oh, sorry. Right this way.
You do?
I've seen it before.
You have?
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
Okay.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
But why?
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
Afraid of what?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
-- About what?
About Chinatown. What went down.
What went down?
You tell me, man.
No. You tell me, Shu.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
Well I know that you're innocent, Shu -- even if you forgot.
...-damn phone.
 Talk to me.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY. 
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
I just want to make sure that you both --
Get the hell out!
Great.  Just great.
Ask this one favor --
Of course I will.
A reaction to AZT...
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
It was my choice.
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
I've never treated you like a whore.
You just did.
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
I'm sorry. It is.
Recognizers!
I said, no lies.
Hello Meredith.
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
What?
Just kidding. Are you alone?
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
Miss Marsh.
Little boy?!  That's him!
He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
He does.
You don't give him enough credit Chas.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever.
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
You can trust me.
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
But why do you want me?
Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.
Everything you couldn't.
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
Well, you know--
He's got his priorities?
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
You okay?
Yeah, of course.
What's going on?
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
You get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here-
Uh-huh!
Run into Josh?
Yeah, but it was okay.
How did he look?
I cut myself.
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
And you'll play Salome?
Who else ?
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Fair enough.
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
They'll love it in Pomona.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
I am not afraid.  Read it!
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
Dog, you look hot.
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
No thank you. I'm off sex.
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
Congrats.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
I thought I was the bad guy!
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
I hope so.
What?
You have no personality.
Hey, where does it say that?
Never mind.
Warm them up.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
And his wife?
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
Oh, my.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding.
I'm not wearing any.
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
No, thank you -- what's your name?
Belle --
Thank you, Belle --
They don't even have Dolby.
-- offer me money --
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
Who screamed?
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
He's a good man.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
And they were two of them. Look --
Nah.  Hates his wife.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Three years.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
That's not what they're tellin' me.
That's why they call it "fuckin' with ya." Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
It's probably because you got him fired.
Ya think?
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
Screw me?  That can't be right.
So nice
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
'Terrorists?'
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
Excuse me?
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
And then what?
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
Hush, sweetheart.
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
Twenty minutes max.
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
Goals are important.
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
We are all impressed.
Nothing is easy.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
Six months.  Eleven days.
Till today, I haven't believed a word.  Now, I'm curious.  Six months, eleven days.  I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me.  Where to?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
But how... how do you know my name?
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
Hey, wait a minute!
Hey, what's that?
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
Only this far.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Who? Miss Dawson?
Yes, sir.
Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
And I didn't have an argument.
What?
Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
Oh, thank you.
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well I appreciate that.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
Of course, of course...
So...
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
It certainly is.
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
...repeat, we're armed...
Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
This is the big moment...!
Oh God!  Help!
Ok.
Especially not your dad.
I won't.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Stag?
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
I can't right now.
Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
I'm staying.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
She didn't push me into coming.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
How would you know?
Look!
Why did she have to die?
Only God knows the answer to that.
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
Jeanne... calm down...!  Calm down, Jeanne!
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Mostly old garbage.  Today we found a '48 Hudson.
He used your exact words.
You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
Who is he?
He's my younger brother.
You have a brother?
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
Sure.
I think you're right.
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
You do it... you first!
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
You first!
Okay!
You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
I did, yeah.
You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Why not?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
You want me to talk to him?
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
I can't talk to you, you met my wife, I...
Yeah, we sure have.
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
Don't.  I don't want it.
Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
She don't look no worse to me.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
What did you say, boy?!
I said, she's in great shape.
I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
They gonna rush us?
They're just insurance in case we run.
Yeah...fine.
Not when they fly.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
Roger, no.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
I know. I'm sorry.
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
Thanks for reminding me.
When was that?
Nineteen-oh-nine.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Well, what about us?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Oh, no, no, no.
You're unbelievable.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Oh, fuck it, man!
Over my dead body.
No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
I know you will.
Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
Later.
Okay honey, but don't be long. I got plans.
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
Who's playing?
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
Awfully.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
But you are interested?
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey -  This your ride, Chili?
How do you suggest I go about it?
He's touched your heart.  You're overwhelmed.  You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out.  Give me the ear piece.
Tachlinkov.
Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
No, of course not, why should you be sorry?  You're the new Peter Appleton.  You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that.  Very noble.
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
The deuce you say.  That crate!
Of course I didn't.
You know I won't be seeing you.
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
What do you want from me?
Why not?
You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
I think so.
You been followin' the news coverage?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
Susanville, Soledade.
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
No.
Did you hear that click?
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
Don't panic.  I might be wrong.  Hello?  I guess I was wrong.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
Go with God.
Yeah?
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
What happened?
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Do you know where he went?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Who, Benny's little sister?
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
No.
Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.
I don't know.
What's this?
Got me.
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
She's okay.
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
So hello.
Mr. Thomerson.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Yes I did.
Fine. How's everything going?
Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
How?
So?
We think in miles, not kilometers.
So how many miles do you think it is?
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
And his writing?
The moron?
He's not a moron.
And who's Lydia?
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
I... You're not going to understand this.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
What does that mean?
See, I told you!
Well, what the hell does that mean?
I thought... if... if I can help him in some way... you know?... get him this girl he loves... Then... maybe.... things'll start changing for me... My luck, ya know... Maybe...  Forget it... It's a stupid idea.
Am I what?
Making it with my mother?
Is that what you want?
I did it. I guess that means something.
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse.
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
I still like UPSTART the best.
This an accident, Walter?
If you want it to be...
My epitaph.
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
The Eradicators!
I think I'll hang around.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
But she just got here...
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
What did you expect - live sables?
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
All right -- it's said!
Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
So I'm told.
What?
You know Sid Fletcher?
I work for him.
Do you?
Yes, I do.
Fine.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
Should we knock?
He probably already knows we're coming.
This?  Naw...
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Which is?
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Money.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I don't know. You tell me.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
A hunting accident is perfect.
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
You paid $50,000 for your character?
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
There isn't any us.
Yes there is.
No, you may not.
Okay.  Fine.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
Well, he worked around.
And his age?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Any other family?
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
Okay, thanks very much.
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
What message?  What motorboat?
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
Oh, he does!
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
And where's he going to be?
He's going to be ashore with you.
With ME?
That's right.
Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
Out Loud?
Then we got'em!
Yes, I believe he did.
Where we going -- ?
We're going shopping -- !
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
This is Quint, Missus.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
He's busy.
Well... is everything all right?
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
Okay so... what's the safest place?
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
What?
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
Who's that?
I have a pretty good idea.
Adam and Evil.
Good idea.  Flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises.  Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it.
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
And what is that?
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
Not likely.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
So what Jew would you kill first?
Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
Great. How??
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
What are you talking about?
In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz.  G'day.
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right?
So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
No.
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
Muncie!
Did you do it?
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
That has the added virtue of being true.
Why do you all keep asking me?
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
No.
Not only that, he copied us!
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
No. Laudanum.
Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
Yeah.
That's another thing I can't do.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
We don't?
What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
I never had sex with you!
Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
Do you know how to disable the injector?
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Like I said, I...
What's your name?
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
We went through the door...
Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
Johnny 
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
Not French registry?
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
Jos doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Oh, please...
What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Someone broke into this room.
Anything missin'?
Doesn't look like it.  We're damned lucky.  This statue is priceless.
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
Incredible.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
Exactly.
Richard, you know something -
And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
You bastard.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
More.
More's gonna cost you.
No...you idiot!
I will.  See ya!
Right now.
Okay! Jesus!
I felt like it.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
Go fish.
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
What other job you got?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
I don't wanna work at all.
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
'At's-a fine.
We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
... that's all right.
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
Not very often.
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
Of course he is.
Are you?
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
But I would like to see you again.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
What d'you mean?
You almost got into trouble back there.
I wouldn't have let you.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
No, on the porch.
Oh yeah, and then what?
What?
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Good night, Duff.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam.  They could poison half the country.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!
Not at all.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
It doesn't matter who they are.
And one of 'em is sick.
Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
I put them on together.
I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
I'm not sure.
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Yeah, wasn't I?
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
Erin?  What are you --
You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight.  So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Shep said 8:30.
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Ya got the car?
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Yah, no, I'm sure you are. Shep vouched for you and all. I got every confidence in you fellas.
What?
Porfirio Madrigal is not dead.  I just saw him.
What do you mean?
Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it.
Could have...
Okay, brother.
Don't call me brother.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
I think that's what you ordered.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
How was I leading you on?
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
That's right.
Oh!
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
No -- I guess not.
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
What?
Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
Know what?
Brody's riding his tower.
Oh, shit.
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs.
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Yes?
Can you do it?
I don't know.
Try.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
How about dangerous curves?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
I've got to stop him.
One kiss, my love.  For luck.
Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
This is California, anything is possible.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
Gee, that is a problem.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
Let's try.
This is Mr. Creasy.
You wanna bet?
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
Don't be ridiculous!
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
Show me.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
He's right, Maria.  That's right.
To the oars!
Is this your dad?
That was him.
Is he dead?
Please put it down.
How'd he die?
He was murdered.
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
I'd say you were full of shit.
It's me betrayed him.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
I don't know what else to do.
Help me.
I think we're on the right track.
Who're you calling?
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Trail him!  Trail who?
Nunheim!
I'm sorry.
That was a compliment.
Will you go with me?
Where are we going?
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Sure.
Goodnight.
You don't know him -
You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
<i>The money exchange will take place at Top of the World at the Stratosphere. Get there at exactly midnight.</i>
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
Tim!
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Well, whatta we got here?
A Lucas Jackson.
Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
This is outrageous!
Sure. Why not.
Who?
That kid... the hairdresser.
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
No, you're not wrong--
Am I wrong!
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
But you like that in a man?
You should write that one down.
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
Some prep school thing.
Does it have a human name?
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
I'd never admit that.
Hurry up, Flash!
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
All new houses have noises.
How long does it have to be a new house?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.
I came right from the airport.
Come on in.
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
I'm trying.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
So I'm told.
I had a friend that used to chew glass for a living. In the circus.
What are you talking about?
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Alfred's happy here.
Happy.  You honestly don't know, do you? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes.
She's busy.
Convey her a message.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
Are you deaf as well as stupid?
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
Long ago -- before my father's father.
And it had three lines painted across it?  The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.
Alright, come with me.
No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Decorated?
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
Of his penis, sir?
Mmm...
So?
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
I'm sorry.
Come on, let's go.
Where?
Somewhere.
Hello, glad to meet you.
Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
They hid my car--
You do?
Not by the thousands.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
Potential toxic dump site.
Is there anything that isn't?
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
Barks his agreement.
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
We're all assholes, Bernie?
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Your earrings?
What?
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
I did find him!
What do you mean?
He was down in the shop.
Nick!
It was his body that was buried there.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's a fact.
Wynant's body?
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
Huh?
What things made you so sure?
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Well, don't they?
Sure.
Do you have to say that?
What?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
I say it because it's descriptive.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Well, I wonder why.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
I have a pretty good idea.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
He doesn't have a phone.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
But he won't.
What are you talking about?
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
Let me talk to him first.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
And what?
And... do whatever it is you do.
Yeah, just started.
Where's your coat and hat?
Left them at the office.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his 
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
What. What don't I understand?
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Who's he?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
That's your problem.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
No way. I always do my own work.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
No, sir, it's not.
Who is it?
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
Yeah, Mack?
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
What's that?
You said I was a lady in distress.
Oh, that
What did you mean by that?
Nothing
I what?
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Oh - you're an actress.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Who killed your patient?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
Good.
There is no alternative.
They are with me!
Aye sir --
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
Be careful, Jim...
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
I'll get Rosasharn.
I hope so.
Why?!
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
I'm not pretending anything!
Bertrand, sire.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
Yes, sire?
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
No, sire... I was asleep.
I wanted to kiss her, but she didn't want to kiss me... She slipped away, the moment I wanted to take her in my arms.
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
Mr. D. B. Norton!
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
No, I will not step outside.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
I don't really see what that has to do with...
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
You better check it, Unger.
We vetoed that?
Move out.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
I want to be the way I was before.
Good. I'll show you how, apey.
You disappointed?
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
What?
You smell like baby powder.
So do you.
I never felt so clean before.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
It is for me too.
I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
Moreover...
What?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
What brown hands you have.
That's from skiing.
Skiing? 
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
He is the King.
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
The mean old man with the claws.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Anchor?
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
Oh.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
That way.
Hello?
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
I'll be switched!...
Goodnight, Nicole.
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
"Dear, you're lovely."  "Strap her to the table."
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
What do you want to know?
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything.
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
See, we're very modern.
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine...
What for? Who are you?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
Do you live here in the hotel?
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.
No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Cute.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
I hope she's all right.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
No, I know.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
I know.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
We're going to need some time.
Who are you going to call?
What am I doing?
You're charming the boy.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
That's my cousin, Angelo.
What're you talking about?
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Where?
Here in the canyon.
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
What's gonna happen?
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
Well, like what?
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
Where?
Everywhere!
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
About what?
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
I don't think so.
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Then why don't you change jobs? 
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
No...
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
That's great.
Sean's asleep.
That's great too.  Gorgeous.
Don't get too cocky.
Why not?
You can make a mistake.
Not me.
Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
No, you're not....
I'm terrific... Come on....
He wants to talk to you.
Now it's okay?
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
Well, there's not much to tell.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Bad experiences.
You met people.
Bad people.
Watched television?
Bad television.
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
What's that?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
That'd be good.
It's a --
--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
When?
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
No, I just told you what happened.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
Well, I heard some things.
It's always been a good persuader.
Couldn't you try to communicate with them first - and shoot later if you have to?
We've tried so long to find her.
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
Do you know his number?
No, I don't know...
I want you back too, Viktor.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Do you practice here?
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
What kind of law?
Criminal.
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Only violators and practical jokers.
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
Makes you gag.
Gag on your own invention, then.
Oh, come now...
You invented this, this...
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
It's your play.
Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
You have to sleep for three.
There was an unavoidable delay.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Well what's wrong?
Well why are they tearing the building down?
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Hiding?
Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
Getting to what?
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
I fail to see --
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Case.
Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
I hesitated taking that much.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I'm sure.
I didn't know... I --
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
Cathay?
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
East of Mercia?
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
Flozen foleva not good.
It's terrible.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
You come stealee tleasoo?
Oh no... Don't you understand?
In a minute.
What DID you mean?
I  I've got respect for  for working guys, like you 
Protection?
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
I guess we do.
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
Your phony FBI assholes.
We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
What do you mean by that?
You don't want another dead child on your conscience.
Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
What?
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
Right first time.
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
Just soda.
Plain soda?
Please.
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
That depends.
Oh?
Calm down, Dave, what?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
What did they...
You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
It leads farther than that.
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
...give me protection?
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
If this is someone's idea of a joke --
Please, let's not stop, George.
I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
Radio said negative five.
Negative five?
Yeah.
I don't think it's negative five.
Radio said.
Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
All hands, brace for impact!
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
No.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
That's so typical, isn't it?
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Nothing.
People just...disappear.
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Eerie. Really eerie.
You can?
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Thanks for coming by.
Hey, yourself.  I see youve met my ex.
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
Just some flies.
Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some."
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
They ain't got captains?
Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
Why not?
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
Is that so?
As one Tribune man to another
I don't?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
I'll listen one more minute.
Certainly.
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
You are extremely sexy.
No, I'm not.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Ooooh!
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
Maybe.
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
She told me.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
What do we do?
You got a bag or somethin?
No.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Here.
Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Has he gotten through to any?
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
I've heard of it happening.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
Usually.
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
Sit down!
You going to tell dad?
Would it matter?  And what's that?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
No!
Play with the whip.
No!
How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
What do you know about these men!? They can stand against anything! They've seen more war than most field generals!  They are not cowards, sir!  They are not afraid!
That's cute asshole.
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Philip Swann?
You know of him?
I saw him in Vegas once.
Are you a gambling man?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
What's the difference?
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
Get out of my sight.
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
I'm in the middle.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
He's on to something bigger.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Too late now.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
Get out.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Told you not to call your mama.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
Yeah, and a dimple.
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Sure.
You're the one who found the bodies?
Yes.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
No, nothing.
You knew these people?
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
I see. Then what brought you up here?
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
How about you tryin' to make me?
Oh for...
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
I don't know what to do, Bob.
You'll never find it in the dark.
Gotta go.  See ya soon.  Everybody happy now?
Twelve months in oak.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
I know. I love that.
Since when?
Since I made Lieutenant.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Dick Low's a killer too.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
How do you do?
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
I don't know.
Hey. Look. There must be something.
Anything it samples by physical contact.
It's pleasant down that way, too.
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
Not this gun!
Yeah, showtime for what?
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
How's he doing?
I got him in the stomach.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
What's this?
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
No!  Get me out!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
Well, I just came from an audition...
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Too little.
Too little?  Too little. Okay, wait for me.
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
No -- Kevin, you?
You're androids.
The fuck I will!
It's in your interest, Nels, since the additional passenger in my trunk -- an LAPD officer is probably carrying a few bullets in him traceable to the piece you're carrying.  Tell the man.
I'm gonna call you back.
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
She's right?!
Now?
Now.
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
Don't worry about it, all right?
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
Relax. I know what you meant.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
You quit?
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Work.  Going to work.
No.
Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.
Damn straight.
Get 'em in the vault!
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
No.
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
Why young girls, Walter?
The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point.
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
John, <u>stop</u> <u>it</u>. The case is on its ass, you're closed.  C'mon, let it go for once .. Have a drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer ..
You're damaged goods, lady.
Something I want?
If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
We can look out for ourselves.
What are you doing that for?
She told me I have to.
No, Jim.
I do.  If I don't get my money back...
But then I won't need your money.
That's right.
I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
You wanna talk to her alone?
Yeah.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
You know what I'm saying here.
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
Oh... Okay.
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
God, it's so totally pathetic.
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
All right, who serves?
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
What for? There's nothing more to say.  Get my car, please.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Oh God, that's too bad.
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
I try to be.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
I'm taking a shower.
Need any company?
No.
Want a blow job?
Good night Cecile.
Prude.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Is this whitemail?
Fair's fair.
What do you want?
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Ten-four, hon.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
I don't know you.
You've lived with me for two years.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
You know goddamn well what I mean.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
I know.  I don't get it.
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they?
Shit!
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
Hey ..
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Who was it?
It's Mom.
Yes, I am.
And what are you studying?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Eh, Poli Sci?
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
This life.
This life?
Why do I have this life?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
Thirty-seven.
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
I came to see you.
I can see that.  Why?
Can I come in?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Then you come out here.
Then I'll get caught.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Okay, knock it off.
Truce?
Truce.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
That's right.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
The pumps --
The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.
Mom, I mean dad?
Yeah?
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
What!
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
They?
The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
Stella.
Paden.
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
No!!!
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now.  He's going to Paris.  Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there.
What was that?
In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
It does.
Do you find him attractive?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
No. But when he's in that car...
Have you seen his penis?
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty...
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.
Nothing.
The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
Thanks.
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Yeah ...
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
No. She really liked you.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Wow.
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
Brad, you are drunk.
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
Why is she leaving me?
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
You might have made the whole thing less personal!
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
....because we don't have any mmm...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
Buona notte.
Go find one.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Can I come in?
He's not here.
What?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
He's blessing the house.
Why?
For good luck honey.
-- never mind.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
-- no.
Good for you.
He's a hairdresser.
Stop.
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
Do you miss it?
It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years --
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Nothing.
And when she goes to those places...
She is not my wife.
You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Got it. Puppies.
Go on!
That's all there is.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Well, there is that ...
I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
No.  Not yet.
Got something to show me first?
Fuck you.
We already played that game. You lost, remember?
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Gustafson's accountant.
Yah.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
- looking.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Still missing. We're looking.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
Yes, Master!
Act casual!
Hi. Pat Bateman.
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
Shut up!
OK. Say what it is.
The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where did you stop last?
Stay right there...
What was your last stop?
Elmo's...
Where's that?
About five miles back.
Press a button and they give us money.
Ride with me. We need a haircut.
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!
Can you be there by two-thirty?
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
What did ya do?
I'm a robber.
You're a bank robber?
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
What?
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
How?
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
Tell me.
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
Ours!
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
It sounded like Brenda.
I'll go take a look.
Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
Okay.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
Yeah, you heard of him?
You haven't?
Not that I remember.
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
A fleet?
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
We'll take your supercargo.
Thanks.
The Widow of the Web?
Yes.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
She has the power of vision.
She has the power to kill.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Her name is Death.
She had another name once.
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
Yeah, we're down.
What do you see?
Take the 405 south.
I congratulate them.
I am. Hur you?
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
No.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
Yeah but they looked cool...
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
Absolutely.
That's it?
Yeah.
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
No.
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap.
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
I like the tent better.
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
Apart from those shotguns.
And Tom took care of them.
He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
I trusted you.
We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
Yeah.
So, it's over?
All over.  Did you see your new apartment?
It's ... lovely.
Miss Darrow ... I've been thinking. I would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father. It's a great shame he wasn't able to join us on this adventure. Truly a wonderful man.
You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
Step inside.
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
What did she do to me?
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
I felt like she almost killed me.
If she held on any longer she could have.
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
How about if you try disappearing.
I don't know. Should you?
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
The long end. Big con.
Nobody does that single-o.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
I've heard the name.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
Is that right?
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
Yes... they were.
Good.  Where are the English?
Everywhere.  Where is the food?
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
I know...
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
He's on the other side of the river.
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Is she?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.
What are you going to do to him?
I'm going to try to remove it.
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I am. Yeah.
Without peer?
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
What?
We've gone insane.
Yup.
Time to leave.
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Thank you.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
Oh, is that what it is?
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Right.
It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.
Who?
Kubelik.
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
A.W.O.L.?
What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
I said call them back.
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Really?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
He was hot, wasn't he?
If I didn't have a fianc in Chicago, I'd go for it.
What is it?
Oh Christ.
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
He didn't say anything?
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
You forget yourself!
What?
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Dignan, I --
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
Good-morrow, cousin.
Is the day so young?
But new struck cuz.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
In love?
Out--
Of love?
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
No, cuz, I rather weep.
Good heart, at what?
At thy good heart's oppression.
Farewell, my cuz.
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
Mickey?
He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |But Mickey doesn't like it like they do.  I suppose that's why he's good at it.
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
Okay.  I love you too.
I don't want you to wait for me.
That's something you can't decide.
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
Yeah, hurry up.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
What are you serious?
Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
Hello, <u>King</u>.  How the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>Get</u> out...  <u>Get</u> out... Well, man, you fall in love like a <u>Hillbilly</u>...  Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick-up,   Listen, King:  <u>Get</u> your fat redneck ass out here, <u>willya</u>...
...but the President wonders about the Possible Albanian Backlash...
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
Yes.
Why did you lie to me?
Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
..it's really about family and tradition...
..harmonica style is okay.
I just love being a sister.
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
Then, what good are you?
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
That's a lie...
Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Shit.
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
Peugot convertible ...
What color?
Gray.
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
Okay. I guess so.
Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Where do you think? With Sue.
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Thank you.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
From a -- girlfriend.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
I'm sorry, but I...
What?!  You're sorry?  I don't believe that for a minute.
Yeah.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Hear what?
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Now?
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
This way.
Deal the cards.
What?
Dad!
What?
Dad!
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
There you go again -- you know I didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just get well -- do what the nurse tells you -- I mean Baxter -- and I'll see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran. 
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
But, Paulie, please.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would?
Yes, sir.
Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
I don't want to talk any more.
Wasn't my intention to hurt Wilder.  I'm telling you the truth.  I liked the man.  I only meant to get loose... to survive. Your cheechako boyfriend better understand that.  Listen, I've got some money put away --
The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
Shift to your left.
Nothing....
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
That's a terrific idea.
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
You got it, Dr. Argon.
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.

I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
That's swell.  I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you.  You were always the best of them. 
Yes, Amy?
Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
Yes?
Do you still want me to sit on your lap?
Why?
What do you know about them?
...<u>nothing</u>...
Precisely.
What did Albania ever do to us?
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
Here's what you got to do:  Get your Press Office, Right now.  To deny;  There <u>is</u> no report of Albanian Activity.  They have to deny it. Now, get the C.I.A.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
Fuckin' freezing.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Five years. Since it opened.
How long ago was your makeover?
My what?!
No, the place. The remodeling. moving everything around.
Actually, you may have.
You done?
Nothing. Hold please.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass.  What's up with your hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
Why?
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
Oh.
Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
I don't know.
What does that mean?
Listen to what you want.
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
That's It?
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
Insurance?
Load it for her.
Where you going?!
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
Hello, Sid.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
No. I'm not busy.
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Wash her.
What with?
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
I. sold the car.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
If you call that a kiss.
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
That's another thing... it's spring.
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
I'll be here.
- we made a fire.
He's in charge.
Are you a doctor?
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
Let's go.
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
Who is it this time--my mother?
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
Say that again?
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
Wow!
What?
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
Oh.
I've got a gig tonight.
Oh?
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
Doesn't it have a name?
I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
Spent it all on beer....
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
I'm a what?
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Forever together.
I'm not sure.
Do you like me even a little bit?
More than that.
Got you!
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I'll be out in a minute.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
I... How long have I been here?
Three days and thats three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.
I was saved at the last minute.
How?
Well ... I'll tell you ...
Yeah?
Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.
Aristotle.
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
Then we cannot go.
Because...?
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
Those are dreams.
You killed her!
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
Where are the tapes?
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
A pass.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
They don't have a murder weapon?
No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  Remember?
Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
No, I didn't.
Why not?
Because I never got around to it.
Well, why?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
No!
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
No, it's nothing like that.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Well, what, then?
I don't want to talk about it.
Then why'd you call me?
I don't know.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Then who wrote the report?
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
Stay back!  I'm okay.
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
I'm not planning on it.
I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Don't do that.
Why not.
Sue the shit out of 'em.
Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
Well , who's in command here?
I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
No, thanks.
Great.
I bet.  That was our rent!
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
But my head...
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh I think you do.
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
When? Today?
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Right, right...
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Right.
So he killed himself.
Oh.
Like last night, Veronica?
No questions.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Get rid of them.
I'll be okay.
It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got.
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
What happens in tow and a half hours?
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
No, sir.
Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system.  As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want.  Anything.  If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.
Thank you.
Don't wait by the phone.  If he's really been walking this whole time, he's out of our jurisdiction...
Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
You all did.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
I know.
Where's the rest?
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
What that?
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
So do I.  Sort of.
Cecile.
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
A hundred and one next month.
Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead.
I dunno...
I beg your pardon?
So where do we begin?
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
So what do I get in return?
Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.
As a tumor.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't!
No.
They're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't trade having them for anything.
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
How?
Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...
Jumped where?
Out of the car.  He jumped out of the god damn car!
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
Acquired?
So to speak.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
We're aware of that.
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
I can see that.
Yes?
I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.
I love you...
Right now, if you like.
The only one.
We're using-
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
A delicious amalgamation, is it?
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
That a fact?
Yeah.  It's a fact.
What about you?
You need collateral.
Like this?
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
... Manly?
You let us worry about that.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
What do you think would be in order?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Okay, I think I could swing that.
So what else is new?
Vince...
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
Today was the deadline, Vince.
I don't see how you can even think of it now.
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
Who the fuck is he?
-- a fucking cop.
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Always has been.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Who?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Who?
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
When'd you do it?
While you were sleeping.
I wish to say something.
Go ahead, be my guest.
Yes, Ma.
And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
How old are you?
Oh, please...
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.
I'll be here.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
It has to be done.
Who?
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
That must make it tough.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Oh. Well I am.
Hm?
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
'That right? Good for you.
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:  Seven-Minute Abs.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
No, Kevin --  That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
Leave me alone!
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
A meeting with who? You and Karen?
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
A visitor.
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
But could I just tell you this one thing?
What?
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
Some bath oil?
Tht was summation, Your H...
Hand me the phone.
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
The mountains?
That-a-boy. Hospital.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
Must be.
And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared.
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
Look.
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
I didn't feel well...
Let me take you to the hospital.
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
What?
Anything.
What?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
Whatever I can do to help.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
The Lord will provide.
Keep your voice down.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
No shortage of suspects.
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
Blow out the candles!
Well...
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
What's the first?
Lawyers.
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
Hi! Star.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
I won first prize.
Come on.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
That's because he misses you.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.
What arroyo - how did you get to it 
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
What?
You like me better like this.
Yes.
No, I don't.
Why not?
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
Yeah.
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Are you going to leave, Mr. Kirkeby, or do I have to throw you out?
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
What?
Fight. You know.
Yes'sir.
You struck some gold, didn't ya?
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
Did we tape the Duke game?
Claire...
This is the person...you were talking about?
Yeah ...
I never been up in a plane before.
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
Aye, for us there is.
You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
Yes it is...
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
So there is only one key...
That's right...
And it can't be forged?
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
Where you were when your husband died.
I can't tell you.
You mean you don't know where you were?
I mean I can't tell you.
You were seeing someone, too.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Your lips, they didn't move.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
When did she die...?
Who is this...?
This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.
Get your hand off me.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
Go fuck yourself.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
He's not.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Help, Daddy!
What?
The marriage!
Well, what does it matter to you?
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
He a Black man or an Indian?
Both.
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Uh, huh.
Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone?
Thank you, sir.
Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
Good girrrl!
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
This is a good deal here, Marty.
Yes.
Where are you now?
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
Are you hurting her?
No, protecting her.
Not even close.  What happened?
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
He knows I do not love him.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
I understand.
Good. We all understand each other. You, Gregory and I. We all know. There is sunlight in the streets and work to do. Both of you - you're off to work.
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
Those creatures..!
Don't let them hear you.
What can we do?
I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
Yes.
Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,  It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back,  You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother,  One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  So I'm worried. I can't fight them  I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.
You'll call me, right?
Yeah.
When?
Tomorrow?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Okay.
Test?
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
More wine!!
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
You can do it.
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
Three days.
Three days??!!
The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...?
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
You went for it.
In the abstract...
So I'm making it concrete.
Why?
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Do you need five grand?
Is that what I just said?
You need money?  Is that the...
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
I do?
Yes.
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
Thanks.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
The who?
You should know. She's in your dream.
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
..not in time to save him.
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
We're not canceling.
I know.
I won't even discuss it.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Yeah. You.
Okay. Okay.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
And Sanctuary?
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
Fron kon steen!
Are you putting me on?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
No, Fred ereck.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I see.
You must be Igor.
He ain't losin' nothin'.
I'm moved beyond words.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Why?
She sits down.
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
... Who are you?
Who do you think I am?
In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
So did I.
Three.
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
How do I get the horn back?
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Not very precise directions.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
Ask away, sweet man.
What became of the princess?
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Is she fair, this princess?
Exceeding fair.
As fair as me?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
She's dead!
No!
Dead, dead, dead.
I don't believe you.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
What is it?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
So?
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
... He ought to put him in here.
It's too soon to move him.
So tell Calvin.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Well, that's why you got it.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Well, go find his lazy ass.  I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
What?
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Why not?
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I mean...
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
Oh God!
You're hurting me!
Stop!!!!
Daddy. Let go.
What do you want from me?
LET GO!
Don't know.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I'm sorry, Ward.
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
Who's got him?
The heelots!
Who?
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
And you agreed?
Yes.
Why?
What would that make Mom?
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
Since when did you drink diet soda?
Too old.
But if you could?
Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
- Four wheel drive?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
I need a drink, that's all.
White House Situation room.
Open it.
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
Great, good.
No, it's not right.
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
We was coming to see you.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
We're starving.
D.C., Chief.
Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.  Well, it's not gonna happen!
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
Maybe the Feds got it.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
Don't even start.
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
Fixing a leak under your sink.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
And you chased one?
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
Do I have to?
Yes, I'd like you to.
I wisht it was day.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Man bones?
Some, I guess, but mos'ly cow bones.
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
In case you get back before I do.
Where are you going?
I'm travelling too.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
You are the father.
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Old?
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
. . . What?
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
You lost Ben?!
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
How's our friend?
You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
Tell me.
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
Oh God, I'm going to throw up.
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
There's nothing to forgive.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
Of course, Nick...
You are right.  But it is a trap.
So what?  I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss.
You're too kind.
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
- I told you! He was there! -
- But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond?
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Last night?  I was at home.
Us? We been... moonlighting.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Excuse me?
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
That was way back...
Within your time, buster. Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice, normal woman who shoots her husband.
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
Yes, I know, I do that to people.
I'm not like you.
What...?
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
Does he have the spot?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
What do you think?
True.
You decide.
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
In my quarters, Uhura.
Yes, sir.
My Dad always drives my Mom.
So?
So that means I have to ride with you.
You're not a woman.
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
Ok.
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
I'm sure that's it. 
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Of course.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Yes it does.
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Start with what you knew then.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...
I'm done talking. Get out.
You can't do this.
Really?
Pleased to meet you.
Come one!
Something like that.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
What the fuck do you want from me?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?
You think that's too much?
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
That sounds sensible. 
What?
Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
wasn't anywhere near this place
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
You look upset.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
The main spire.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
...I learned a long time ago.
A son.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
Talk to me, Charlie.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
I told you you'd get your money back.
He thinks I care about the money.  I care about you. Do you care about me, Eddie? We're together a long time, night and day. So how do you say goodbye?  You gimme the car and a hundred bucks. You think I care about the dough, the car? I care about you.  This boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw. A real high-class con man. He can charm anybody into anything. Did he ever tell you how well we were doing on the road? We had everything: we ate good, we slept late, we had money to burn. Whisky, dames...  Excuse me...  I'll tell you what -- take her along.
Hong Kong.
What?
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
Found what?
What I want to do!  Right now. What is really inside of me.
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you.
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
What are you supposed to do?
Kill the Governor.
Hi Walter.
How's business?
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
Yes...?
I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
Because I can't.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
You did it for Namath.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Now you're talking.
You've got good days and bad days.
Who did it?
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
Oh no.
What?
I've got to go.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
He talked to you Himself?
No.
Through someone else?
Yes.
Who?
I can't say.
Why?
She'd punish me.
One of the other Sisters?
No.
Who?
She'll be awright.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
This is real, Bananahead!
So?
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
You decide.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Well are --
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Yeah.
Why not?
Because it's what we have to do.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
Okay, fine.  So...stay out of it.
Just do it, old man.
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Technical responsibility, real responsibility -- what difference does it make?  Jessica lives -- or she dies. That's what we're talking about!
Watch it, shithead!
Here! This is it!
Who are you?
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
Oh?  How's he doing?
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
No doubt.
Ellie...
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
You know why I'm here.
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
You can't just pull the plug, David.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Meaning...
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
David --
It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
Thank you, ma'am...
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.
We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
Sure.
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Well, okay. I got you some.
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Ma'am?
Yeah.
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
We sure like havin' you.
Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
It's go time, Billy-B.
Starving.
Take your time.
Thanks.
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
No, no, no.
Well it's just not true. We wouldn't be looking at you -- why are you wearing this suit? Did you say hello to your brother in law's?
That's very nice.
What?
Just got a reading...
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Roll 'em.
Action! The scene starts.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
Why not?
I just don't.
What is it you've heard.  Come on, let's have it.
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
Sorry.
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you.
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
No.. I've slept enough.
Kay-em 14.
Barbie from hell...
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
I'm afraid I cannot assist.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
Tell him I have a fiance, Dickie has a fiance and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
No, I need the original note.
There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
What's that about?
Forget it.
You think he's getting out of here?
Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
I don't think I want to hear this --
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
Yeah.
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
Get outa here.
Daddy....
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
You're not?
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
Yeah.  Maybe so.
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
I batted!
You batted or you bunted?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Well, then I'm quitting.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Who's in it?
We think so.
Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
Ah, chigaau hito da. Hanashi kata ga okashii.  Yes, this must be true. You talk funny.
What?
This is Alvy Singer!
What?  What kind of episode?
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Like what?
Like Freddy.
Heather, has there been another call?
Suppose not.
A few years older, perhaps.
How's your arm?
"Punks", huh?
Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Yeah but what are you doing?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
So you can't talk to me?
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
Well, I can't talk though --
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
Yes, I'll be there.
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
Ok, bye-bye.
Thank you --
I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
I'm sorry, I can't.
Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
No it is not!
Hold still.
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
What was that?
It's a pleasure...
Ah, cheer up!   Don't lose heart over what happened tonight.  I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success!
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
I'm tryin' boss.
My God, you're serious.
Ask anybody.
Can I ask anybody now?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
And if I win?
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
That can't feel good.
No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
Yeah... that must have been it.
B-Black...
Where is it?
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
Whah?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Whah is dissdee?
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
Maybe I should come along.
Why was he missing for twenty days?
Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India. It wasn't until that they sorted through their gear...
I guess that makes you the smart one.
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
I'll tell him we'll take two.
Are you even really alive?
My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
You didn't know anything about me.
I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
I don't care about the rest of the world!
Can't make enough swords!
Can't make enough axe-heads!
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
Huh!
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only.  When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Will I be?
I don't know.  I won't be.
But he was called...
Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
It's not optional!
Jesus...
I'm leaving.
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
Isn't that always the way?
So, you're just kind of a roving --
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
Oh, that's fine.
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
Yes, sir.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
You deserve it.
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
I never met her.
There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
I haven't any.
You haven't got a uniform?
No, sir.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Why, I don't know.
You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
Yes?
Who's the old geezer?
Some judge...
What? No. Nothing.
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Where is it?
What?
Where is your luggage?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Oh no.
Sir?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Of course.
I wanted to see the white horse --
I'm cool.
See you Monday.
Where?
A place we have, that we know is protected.
No.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Absolutely.
Why'd you want to help us?
Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
They're Seymour's.
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Right.
You can say that again. What do we do?
Nothing we can do.
I know, because I felt it myself --
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
AND DID YOU?
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
Go to hell!
Why was it you never took her by force?
Who's to say I did not?
Was it impotence?
NEVER!
Then it must've been love --
I didn't aim to.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
No ma'am.
I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.
I think I will.
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
And have you mended them?
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
I spaced out.
Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
Why not?
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Oh, I see, I see.
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Fifteen years, huh?
Fifteen years, yeah.
Yeah. Oh, God bless!
You're not taking my baby!
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
You set me up.
I just wanted --
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
No! I just wanted
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
I assure you we came close many times-
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really.
Oh, George ...
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
To kill me.
You understand obsession better than you let on.
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
That's usually my line.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
Would you? I'm not so sure.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
Excuse me.
And into a black dress.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
Goodnight, Suzette.
I suppose it is.
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
I want to speak with you.
Go away, unless you got my money.
It's me, Peerless.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now.
Yes.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
Remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day? More beautiful than any church I was ever in.
I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
Did your voice tell you to jump?
No...
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
No...!
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
That's now what I meant...
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Yes, but...
And you didn't jump of your free will?
No!
Oh?  Perhaps someone pushed you then?
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
It's not what you think.
Me, too.
I'll call you again.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be walking funny.
Not if they're where I think they are.
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Figured what out?
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
Is Miss Dugan well?
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
The coward!
He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Doesn't look good.
The what!
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
You've got to help around the house!
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
You should have helped her without being asked.
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
Yah, okay, but, uh -
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
GOT IT?
Okay, real good, then.
Thinking.
About?
Nothing.
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up...
Why... ?
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  You know... little voices tell them bad things.
Yeah whaddya want?.
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
It sucked.
What're you doing?
I'm sorry.
Who?
Paul's grandfather.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Down the ... er ...
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
They'll be along.
No.
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
What new information?
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
He's got exposure.  He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance.
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?
In three months! Papa.
Well what?
Aren't you going to say anything?
What do you want me to say?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
You leave something out?
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
And?
And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Say what, Manray?
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
Aw, c'mon.
That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
What?
What's that?
What did you say?
I said how's it going?
I didn't hear you.
Well that's what I said.
And my mouph is frozen.
I have to save Eugene!
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Jeffrey. honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do. it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
Did you have a nice time?
Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.
Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
We all got it comin', Kid.
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
Real good.
See how fast he is -- damn!
Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
How be dat?
I don't know who I am.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother. 
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
I have his journal.
You what?
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
You didn't show it to anybody?
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
I know.
I was here!
...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
Go ahead.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.
Hang on.
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
You think you've found your calling?
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
Also boring.
But I still don't think...
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
You?  Married?
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Excuse me?
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
So you left her?  Just like that?
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Yo, Paulie.
What?
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Looks, huh?
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Hey --
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Don't get mental, man.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Ya always in a bad mood --
...Adrian ain't sharp.
What?
The angels... I think they're calling your name.
Two weeks ago.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
What?
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Let him answer.
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
She lived there.
I don't mean her --
Bet you like that shit.
Keeps me out of the army.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
Heard where?
Where I come from. Boston.
We are?
It's all going to work.
I just got goosebumps.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds.
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
JOSH!
Did I say that?
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
No.  You don't want his help.
No you're not!
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance.
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
Dont know any doctor jokes.
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
You've been using me --
I've been using you?!
You didn't know my father --
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?
As you wish.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
Almost immediately.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
Fuck it, I don't need the key.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
I just did.
I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
No way.
Go!
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
How?
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
I'm cold ... so cold ...
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
Ben ... Ben ...
Luke ... you are the only hope.
Damone. It's Mark.
Mark. What happened to your date?
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
Did you go home and get it?
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Am I not obligated to?
Yeah, I just got back.
It is a difficult situation.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
I don't know...
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
You said you were visiting friends!
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
Tonight it is.
You don't understand.  I mean it. Really.  I'm not up for this...
Hi.
Hi.
Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?

William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
To you maybe.
I also like bananas.
Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe it's time to give a little something back.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Abort the cruise.
A deal's a deal.
You do it.
Why me?
'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
How so?
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
You think this is just about politics?
Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
Always good advice.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Who?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Never heard of him.
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
The point being:  he's also a candidate for my job.  If we can pull this off, maybe I can restore their faith in me.
Outfit? What's he talking about?
Do what?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
I do?
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
Excuse me?  Start?
It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
Boogered!
I didn't follow you!
You followed me!
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
Well, what is your definition of following?
Following is different. I was spying.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
Where do you live?
Excuse me.
Where do you live?
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
They are?
The cards... you're bank.
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
Saunders said--this whole thing was *his* idea to get graft--!
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
This is Bandit I, come back.
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
-- confirming everything we already know --
-- I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right --
Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for me, if you never do anything else...
Annie's a smart lady.
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, trs bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandmes services quelquun rcemment... Vous tes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe its there with...
Its not.
Well, Im sorry. I...  This is my nephew... And my brother, Tim. Ive got the week off and hes come to stay.
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
It doesn't have eyes.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
I wouldn't think so.
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
We're supposed to be in school.
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Do you tell lies?
Stay away, Sam.
Leave the boy.  Take me.
Well, good.  Good for you.
Anyway, that's why I came by.  I need to fix this button.  Do you have a needle and thread?
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
Catherine, I want you come live in my house with Marty and me.
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
Sustained.
She's right. It's none of my business.
What for Paul.
Do as I say. I will be there soon.
Oh, you think?
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
How deep does this go?
I don't know.
Ah... yes, enormously.
Well, fire away.
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
I did.
Any bit in particular?
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?
OK...where do you want to start?
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
No.
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Yes.
I fear nothing.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Bob?
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
I don't mean anything by it.
Yes.
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
How much do I pay him?
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
WHAT?!
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
In a fire, as I recall.
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
And a lot more. Can we talk?
No harm. No foul.
Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
Nothing.
That's a rifle you have?
No.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
No.
Open the bolt!
Yes... I...
You can call me Sister.
... Thank you.
You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
How about making friends?
Yes.
You believe me, right?
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
He's Canadian.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
He needn't disturb you.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
He won't disturb us then.  I think he's after morphine.  There's a war.  Where you come from becomes important.  And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
What, the lunatic who --
"Cecil Stipe." Find it.
It's not really important.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Why are you being so dramatic?
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
What feeling?
That it's not over yet.
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
What's the matter?
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
I think it might hurt her to know.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word?  The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children.
For everyone.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
I can't do that.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
I hate chickens.
I'm Mary 2.
Where do you live, Mary?
Here.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
I'm very smart.
When do you go up?
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
You killed my friend!
Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
They're running the rest of me next month.
It's chinchilla.
Oh, it's so soft.
It's nice isn't it?
Oh...
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.
I found it! I found it!
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
We won! We won!
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
Did you hear what he sang?
What?!
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
No.
No? No, what?
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
Yes.
How do you know he'd buy them?
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
You haven't talked to him.
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
Just a minute!
I can't do that.
Why not?
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Because you killed one of my crew.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
No. Just confidence.
I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
It truly is.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
About a quarter to one.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
It was just an idea.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
Who told you that?
Isn't it true?
No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
We'll just put up the top.
What?
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Listen to me!
...they just hadn't thought it through...
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
True.
I'd have been a great dope addict.
The - - agility.  You're right!
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
I'll be damned if you are!
...Stanley Moss...
8 days and we bring it back home....
Nothing, go back to sleep.
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
It's too dangerous....
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
You need six.
I'll be there in three hours.
Don't speed, Chase.  It's not...
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
I did, didn' I, El?
You got another ball comin'.
What's wrong, Allison?
An alternative literary venue!
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Squatted it.
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Not that I know of.  Why?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
That's part of it.
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
It's always the little things.
Yep.
-- open quantum latches --
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Then you still love me?
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
It's ecstasy, Sal.
Say the greeting again...
Yew-cheen chef-faw... emphasis on the 'cheen' and the 'faw'...
You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
David! David! I can't believe this!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I'm following you and David, if you-
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
Not her.  It.
Name it.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
Yes.
I wanted to speak with you about...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
My wife told me to look into...
Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something.  You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants.  I know you do... 
Look, uh...
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
Move it out.
Movin' it out, boss.
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
Uhh - martini?
Olive or eyeball?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Stu Miley.
Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
Joe -
What?
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
To hell with sex.
Who is this?
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
...Us? DUDE
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
Help me with this.
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Are you scared?
What is it?
You wouldn't believe me.
I would.
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
I can't do that --
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
I can't leave when I'm so close.
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
That's absurd --
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
But you must.  It's the only way.
I just got released five minutes ago.
George, are we gonna do this or not?
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?
Show her in. Then go to bed.
She knows it was our fault!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
With the same friend?
How much!?
Hundred-fifty.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
I'm going home!
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
I don't know how to make her funny.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
What what's about?
I...wait, what are you talking about?
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
The tennis player?
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees.
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
Huh?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Oh -- great.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
Bud brought it to me.
Bud?
Here's my favorite.
Ok.
She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."
Yeah --
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
What time is it?
After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.
You're some fucking jerk.
Won't they come out here?
I don't think so. One come out here once an' I clipped him from behin' with a fence stake. They ain't bothered since.
You're not going to use it, are you?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Right.
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Guess you're right.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here.
It's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
Give me an ETA.
An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.
What the heck they doin'?
Must be some sort of mining facility.
And determination.
You have to sign for it.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
How much is the wife offered?
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
You ready?
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
Fine.  He's got a plan
And you're going to lead us.
Yeah. Me?
Yes, you.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
That's right.
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
Gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else - another kin of life. People can be very frightened of change. I know I was.
Hilarious.
I actually know this one.
You do?
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
You've got to go to sleep now.
I want to go home...
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
He had help.
Help from whom?  Christ.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
It will end tonight.
Must you fight him?
He will not stop until it is over.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
Jack, he's starting a conversation...
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Are you?
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
What happens if I want to sneeze?
You won't. Not without permission.
Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!
Shhh. Shhhhh.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
All right. All right. All right.
Yes, just the two.
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
But tell me why ...
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
Simone!
Yeah.
What did he say?
No.
Ok.
Hide your laptop here.
No.
You can't bring it.
I'm not leaving it here.
Why?
Just do it!
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Basement bingo?
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
It's alright, Dad.
I didn't mean to...
I know, Dad.  I know...
You know my back -
You want to come along quiet?
How's Atley -- ?
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
Let them go --
How's that?
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You'll leave -- ?
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
I don't golf...
When did you first notice this?
Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha- what do I have?
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
Mornin', Daddy...
We met.
Both would be nice.
Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
Thanks.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Whoopee.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
That's preposterous!
Negative.  Negative.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Can we move it to a different orbit in time?
Shut up! All of you!
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Oh yes. That's fine.
Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
It's okay.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
When I have no reason to doubt.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
-- What could he have done to warrant that?
I'm not sure... I might have.
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
In the car?
In the car.
I see what you mean.
We're not sure.
What do you think he did?
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
Of course, I do!
It has.  How's business?
Good.  And how are you?
Fine.
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?
No.  He's - no.
Oh God.  Oh God.
Why special?
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
That's because I've never been here before.
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
I order you not to!
Yeah.
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
I have.
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
Sure.
My boat's neat, dad!
I want him out of the ocean.
Free your mind and return he will.
My mind fills with so many images.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
I see a city in the clouds.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
It is the future you see.
Me?
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
Jack, wait...
Just a second, that's all!
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close.
I'm looking for some perfume.
Any particular brand?
Well, it's for a woman.
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
Greetings.
Listen to her singing.
I'd like to begin.
Begin what?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
Would it stop you if I did?
No.
You're what?
I am better.
Kit!  Where've you been?
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Why'd he want you?
Where's Jones?
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line?
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
I've really got to --
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down.
There's some stuff that's hard to part with. Editing's stuff's up there--
Who left -- where?
The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
Closin' down, sir.
Vaughn, Burke, move to the end of the street.  Fan out and work your way back to the motel.
What?
I asked if you felt like a drink--
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow.
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
I just wish we'd done it sooner.
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
Lower.
Lower.
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.

He looks wonderful, Jackson...
No baby, you got it wrong.
This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me?
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
So, I guess it worked.
I know a shortcut.
Shortcut?
You don't know what a shortcut is?
You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
Healy.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
I have no claim, Thomas.
But you won't sign, correct?
Correct.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
Bastard.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
You can't do that.
Don't tell me I can't --
They're trying to kill me!
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
It must be great.
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
What the  --  !
That's right.
What do you mean?
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
Wait as long as you like.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
Track you down and --
I guess.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
You got a brew?
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
No, I do not have any of those.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
1952...?
Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
But Charlene...
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
Huh?
4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.
The missing scientists.
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I love you.
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
A simple yes or no would have done.
Want me to lead?
Cute.
I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
Water or mineral deposits.
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
You know exactly where they are!
It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
Who knows?
Maybe later.
How about you?
Hi.
Aren't you a little early?
I brought you something ... From the library.
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
She won't even see me, Pitts.
Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
Smile.
Smile... good?
Yes.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
About the girl.
An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
I didn't use my name.
Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
We've found all of them.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Well, why does it?
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Pushing it is flat wrong.  All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.
Sounds made up.
How are we doing?
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
Can you take me to it?
Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
Here it come: one-two-
Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
To all those cons...
Searching for a money man...
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
-- till he fucked his parole --
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.
Hell yeah, they don't know.
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
Yes, me!
You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.
No, sir!
Never better.
Try the car.
We're leaving.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
What?
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
She's mistaken.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
Why would she lie?
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
Oh indeed?
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Father Perrault is dead.
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Yes.
I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
Do it?
You know...take the pictures?
What...?  What if I say no?
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
Why me?
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
...Oh, did that hurt?
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
I'm doing what I can.
"Blood?"
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Out getting coffee.
Yeah, that's more or less what the others said, too. Out getting coffee... supposed to meet him here... picking up my grandma...
What have you done to my flat?
Yes.
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
No.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
No.
I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
No, I'm an actor.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Anything I'd know?
Maybe. Recognize this?
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
It's so beautiful!
What???
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
The agents --
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
What do you know?
You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
Morpheus, I don't know --
I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
You're paying the bills.
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
This is getting serious.
It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
Go, Chief.
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
I know the one.
Tell her I'm almost home.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Guaranteed, eh?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Damn straight!
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Don't lie to me.
That's the truth.
So I noticed.
I had no idea until after, but --
Tell me later.
I said come on!
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Big?
Yes.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
I'm sorry.
A bit fucking late.
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
Two...
It's not me, it's the engine!  A fat guy fell on it from six floors up!
I just might do that.
How did you settle on the amount?
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
Yes.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Yes.  It would be.
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
This is my way of telling you --
What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
And the moral of that story is -- ?
Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
Bye Will.
Come here...
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
I know.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
What?!
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
Great.
But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
What?
The girl.
I dunno ...
By your leave, sir.
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
We could get back together too.
Were we together?
What do you think?
He looks like a fuckin' loser.
I... I...
Yes, I will.
Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
No I'm not sweetie.
I was the kids' godfather.
And...?
"And" what?
I got to know.  There is never any room for "personal"...
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
I...I don't know...
Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say "permanently" if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent.
How can I?
I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.
Good morning.
Nice spot.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
But you did promise.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
Yes, I suppose so.
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
Put a tap on her phone.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
What?
Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
No... I want to be confessed.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.
I'll come to you when I need you.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
Er, I knew you looked different.
Remember how they used to stick out?
What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
What am I gonna eat?
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
I think they're both virgins.
Oh, Elliot!
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
You're out looking here?
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Ohhhh!
How about you?
Oh.  Well, I live--
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Where are you headed?
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Let me try mine.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
Which one?
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
It goes very fast.
Show me...?
THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
... A piece of paper ...
You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
No.
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
Sir ... six bodies.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
Oh. Goodness.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
Like what?
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
Don't go, Jackie...
I can't just let him stand by the door...
Don't leave me...
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
What for?
I don't know -- I've got to.
Justin?
I think I found something...
Again
Maybe... why do you ask?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
Why?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
Yes, but... I thought...
What?
That you were just indulging me.
No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
What?
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
What happened to them?
I don't know.  We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.
Okay, okay.
A long, long, long...
Okay.
I'm lonely.
Really?
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Sure -- I guess.
Terrific.
Okay.
I'm through with you.
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. -- I'll give you until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you'll come with me indeed.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
Why did you do this?
I don't know!  I'm sorry!
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
I don't know.  Maybe...
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
Sheila...
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
What?
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed.
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
And put it on expenses?
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
I'm listening.
HATE!
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
If you can catch him.
Who does?
Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it.
Wonder what?
If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
She's beautiful, you know?
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
Huh.
I'm fine.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Is he?
Yes.
You figured what?
I figured it didn't matter.  It's my last day of business.   I was wrong.  I'm sorry.  Hey, look what I got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --One of the good ones, too, with zoids.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
Will you calm down?
Fine! Get off me!
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
I'll be back with the coffee.
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
Hard to say.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
Mathilda, stop, please!
Afternoon.
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
What if I
Just do what I tell you.
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
Jesus, I don't believe it...
Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Especially tonight.
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
No, that's not what I'm thinking.
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
What are you talking about.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
What do you actually know with religion?
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
I'm fine, I really am.
I admire your strength.
We all have to be strong, right?
Right.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Charlie...
...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
I ain't going no place with you!
Father, I'm right here.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again...
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
What the hell happened?
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
No way.
Can we just talk this out?
Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
What'd he get you?
A Porsche.
Mm.
Yeah. So, what about you?
What about me? I don't have a car.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Military marching bands.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
I'd like to.
Oh, yeah?
Mm-mm.
Come on - let's go!
The generator!
Screw the generator!!
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
Oh shit! There he is!
Please don't say this.
Mank-
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
Orson. Stop. Just stop
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
I've got to work.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
You're going to stay here...?
Yes.
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Yeah...
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
Okay.
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
Thank you very much.
So ?
He already had a balance of $600,000.
He probably has a history of this shit.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Checking........
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
Your kidding?
There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
Yeah.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
A long time, with one man.
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
Can't it wait till morning?
Please Mom?  I just don't want to be alone.
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
I did.
Hello, Bruce...
You can bring ONE toy...
Just one?
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
I'm getting too old for this game.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
What?
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Only once, at Redstone.
Where...?
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
I'm just having some fun.
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
Save me!
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
Let the press through.
O'Neil, Jordan.
Thought you two were file-closed.
You knew about us?
Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
No way.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Do they know who did it?
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
They think it's school-related?
They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than...  Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
You must have.
Maybe someday.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
That's hard to believe.
But absolutely true.
Oh, Andy, Andy!
My name is Orson Welles
The actor
And director.
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
To make pictures.
You threw it at me!!
I just let go of it.
Right.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
Okay.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
That'll be the day.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
Oh shit, what's today?
Today is Tuesday.  What?
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Hi, Leonard.
YAAA!
You dream about dead guys?
You got plenty of money?
Sure, boss.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
I always have both.
Because I don't love him.
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
We're hung up on something.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
What are you talkin' about?
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
I don't believe you.
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
On their honeymoon.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
They didn't tell me.
Wait, what happened to the tree?
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
That's right.
Okay?
Mm-hm.
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
I was with the Princess.
Where?
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
Go on... go on...
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
And did you?
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
That's it then... the ring!
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
I won't wait up.
Don't cry.
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
I can't.
You've got to get your mind off this.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Go!
And don't ever try to see me again.
What are you talking about?
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
Do you think I care
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Dorothy!
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
You're talking like a crazy person,
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
Go away!
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
I thought I was.  I was confused.
And now?
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Yes.
Have you two had breakfast?
What museum?
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
No can do.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.
I have a duty.
Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
Why I do what?
That.
Why I give pennies?
Yeah. Why you give money.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
What are you talking about?
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
So.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Right.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Shut up.
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Well thanks!
Im sure you do...
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
No way.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
Sign me up.
But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
Okay, stop.
In school.
This going to work?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
We think we know where Betty is.
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
It was okay.
You'll always remember your first time.
It was nice.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Hey! That's my line!
Yes?
Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
Good evening, Monsieur.
Frank.
Come on up.
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes.  Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Why are you carrying the dog?
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
When you eat him, may I have some?
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
... It's time to get this society back on track!
I think so.
You mean babies with you?
What's wrong with me?
You're your own baby.
Ted!
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
It most certainly is.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
In other words, seven times out of a hundred, you're wrong!
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
Nearly a year.
Any attacks of pain since?
Yes, Doctor.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAWN.
I'm sure I could have.
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
No. Uh... family friend.
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
Which one is your brother?
The big one.
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "There is something negative about the place..."  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
No.
That's easy. Antiseptics.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
Hi honey.
Why not?
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
Oh?
The pages filled in?
But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
And you defending her?
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Oh, please!
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
Ye-ah.  Sure.
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
I'm not interested in him.
You're not interested in him?
No, I'm not.
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me -- 
Y-y-y-yes...
Tell us about it...
I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
Oh sure, all the time.
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
It's still against the law.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
Just some buddies.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
In code to STARFLEET... Captain's Spock's tube located intact on Genesis surface. Will relay more data on subsequent orbits.
They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
That depends who writes the history books.  I'm not a quitter ... but I'm not stupid either ... A trial would kill me -- that's what they want.  But they won't get it.
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
Worse.
And then?
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
You are?
Good ol' mild mannered Walter! Give it up.  It doesn't fly with me.
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
1002.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Yes, sir.
Screw you, Jake....
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
Okay.  You got the "item"?
I got the item.
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
How many?
Two main players plus three.
My end?
25% discount on the load.
Make it 40%.
Make it 35.
Deal.
What if?
Someone's gonna see us.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Charlie!
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
Look out that window.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Great ass.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Yeah, I know.
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.
I thought you already left.
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
Get up!
Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
That's great, honey.
What??
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
No, no.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...
I went out to Delmar.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I saw her.
She didn't see you, in other words.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
In Vienna...
Here it is.
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
No way.
I said pull over.
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
I'm only paying two of you guys.
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
Where is she?
Hasn't she had enough?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
My God, but you're determined.
Never been here before?
Must have opened while I was away at school.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
Sorry.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
Sounds like a rough time.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
I'm serious.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
That's what I know.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
With Hypnocyl?
That's right.
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
Just until we get things under control.
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
So do I.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
She didn't look Italian to me.
Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
No sir.
It was fun, anyhow.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
I don't know.
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
Wake up!
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Of course. This isn't a prison you know.  Look if you'd prefer to tell ME what happened, instead of a policeman --
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
Kill me and have done with it.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
Your crime... as well as mine.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
I see it before me.
I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Were you in it?  In the war?
You never saw that picture, huh?
What picture?
Me in my uniform.  Used to be on the bookcase.
All right, Mickey.
Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.
No! Do as I say.
I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Racist piece of shit.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
Good-night, folks.
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
Mama was probably asleep.
Will? Are you okay?
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
I want to see you, too.
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Come home with me.
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
What's this Mama shit?
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
What's the problem, Molly?
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Will?  You could come up here.
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
That's not true.
Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
Oh, lots.
Yeah, that's right.
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
Oh, please, Mike...
Give me a break!
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?"  What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.
We were headed...
...Fort William Henry.
He'll not escape me.
You're on your own... like a true champion.
Trigger.
Kennedy.
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
So?
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
Nervous?
Yeah.
You flew before?
No.
I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise.
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Innocent?
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
My God, what?
The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear:  a classless world.  Not a very real expectation.
My pleasure.
Picking up magnetic interference.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Those sluts!
Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
I got it.
...I see.
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
We only have to shove'em over the moat.
I want to know everything about you.
You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
Because they are all the same.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
I wasn't star--
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Why shouldn't she be?
They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
Did you just say "girls?"
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
Problems?
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
What! Who?
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
Yeah? Well, when I get my hands on a red-headed doll with a southern lingo, I'll--
You better not sing that song.
Why?
'Cause you're too little.
Let's do it.
Yeah.
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Hungry?
A little.
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
Thank you very much. Good day.
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
Borscht?
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
John, where are we g --
Hush.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
Do it!
'Got a good thing, man.
Permission granted.
May I ask, where are you bound?
San Francisco.  And you?
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
It's...doesn't matter....
I ordered lunch.
You ordered it here?
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Down boy.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
No, I cant. Were late for a dance lesson. I guess youll have to finish up later.
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
...not if you've got something to hold on to.
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
That's good money.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
Then what?
I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.
That's not going to happen!
But it could happen.
No it couldn't!
<U>Answer</U>!
We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
On screen.
Hey.
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
No.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
No.
Amsterdam?
No.
Constantinople?
No.
You've never been in Constantinople?
No!
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Yes!
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
But--
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
And harems ... ?
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.

Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
I don't want to learn that!
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!
Mr. Yesil.
I know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge,  I arrange everything - just right.  And I think we get you bail. If very bad, maybe twenty month sentence... But I think we get you bail...
Yes, your Holiness?
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
I been sick. Hold this, will ya?
Well what?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
I live here, remember?
Right on the flight line?
Then get up and do something about it.
What you doing here?
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Don't call me that.
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, Dil --
Apologies, my sweet.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
How you sound?
I won't do it anymore.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
No costume.  No blackface.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
POWs.  And their families.
So I'm supposed to be ...
Compassionate.  Grateful.
Proud?
Sir?
Of them.
Yes, yes.
Fire him.
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
Come on -- come on!
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
Could you come with me please?
Sure. Can Ed come too?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
But you think he fools around.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Sorry.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
Tons and tons.
Where is Sidney's father?
Home--where he lives.
And are the police sure about that?
Why don't you ask them?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
No, I don't.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
No.
Let me go, Dil
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
Um-hmm.
Except for one little thing.
And what's that?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
What --?
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career.
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
What do I got?
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Next.
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
She's having a baby. Twins.
Es impossible.
You can trust me on this one.
It's a miracle.
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
Thank you so much.
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
No--not quite.
You couldn't have known.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
He's a good man.
Better be. You left me for him.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
Ahhhh!
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
They're none of them right.
But why?
I'm going up to the institute.
Now?
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
Man, that is love.
Ah! You have questions?
What are we?
Nothing if not vampires...
Who made us what we are?
Surely you know the one who made you...
But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
did you hear anything before he cries?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
No, nothing, sorry.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Of course.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
There are only two other people in the flat.
Two weeks holiday.
How much money are you carrying with you?
I have five-hundred dollars.
Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
The JFK? In the rain!?
Starling?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
Yes he is.
Well, I need to speak to him.
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
I've got a line on one.
Weird.
I have no intention of having an accident!
It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.
Sorry.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
I'm doing okay.
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Money?
No.  I got a problem.
Let's hear it.
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
Steven??
She's waiting in the conference room.
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Office of--Senator Smith?
*No*!
The man downstairs said number--
No!
Don't worry it's okay!
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
How much do you know?
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
What else did you keep out of the papers?
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
Somebody hurt him?
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
Come in, boy -- come in.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
Yeah?
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
M'm.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
M'hm.
G-go on, I'm interested.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
M'hm.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
M'hm.
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Yeah.
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Sinatra?
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Yeah?
and I keep, you know, it's-
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Whatta you mean? Me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
Will it change your wife?
Will it change my life?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
Life. I said, "life."
I'm sick.
Then I'll take you home. You'll feel better tomorrow.
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
You need to practice.
Don't thank me.
Thanks, babe.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
You wouldn't.
Of course I wouldn't.
There.
Behind the rabbit?
It is the rabbit.
... You silly sod.
What?
You got us all worked up.
Except us.
It IS possible.
Who did you talk to?
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
You stay away from him!
I should'a remembered the eggs.
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
You're not Baxter?
My name is Emmett.
And you're not Baxter, either?
You're all full of shit!
We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
Bobby--
It's been a few years.
Yeah.
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
I need help.
Tell me about it.
How can I reach you?
Are you okay?
Are you still in Crystal City?
Yeah, what's going on?
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
I don't.  Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about.  It's not even close.
Nothing at all?
Complete washout.
That makes me feel just awful.
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
You mean you can't fall in love?
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
What happened?
I don't want to bore you.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Oh, no!
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Talk about sad.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
You poor, poor boy.
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
How can you think about food at a time like this?
What else is there for me? 
Is it that hopeless?
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Have you ever tried American girls?
Why?
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
What?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
You could've killed us.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
I cannot go with you.
Why not?
I belong here.
I don't understand...
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
You sure I can't go with ya?
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
Coney Island??
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
Right.
Then stick with Bialystock!
What, like on va-kay?
Is it real?
Looks real to me.
No, I didn't.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
What do you know of my husband?
I know he left you behind.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
Nine and-a-half years...
That's it.
It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Have you used this type before?
Two thirty.
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
No, really I --
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
What?
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
But nothing did.
Yup. Thats why you get to keep your money.
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
We were such desperate sluts back then.
Yeah, right.
Mom, meet Jango.
Was she? Did you notice?
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
What?
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
I don't know...
We'll need one.
Too bad you're out of it.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
Was in all the papers three years ago. I'm seventy-six, was only seventy- three then. Had a business in Buffalo, New York, called Rats With Wings. Killed pigeons for anyone who wanted 'em killed.
Now we're back on track.
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
Look, can't someone help me?
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
What is it?
Poached salmon.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
I did all right on McCord.
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
You can't believe that.
As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
We gonna stay, ain't we?
You're tootin' we're gonna stay. 
Of course.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Ronald?
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
Yeah, that's better.
What could I be up to, Lula?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
That was in Vietnam.
He's the kind liked it.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
What?
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
What's her problem?
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
Monica, where are you?
I'll have it in a minute.
I'm fine.
You're injured.
It's nothing.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
I'm not married.
Oh.
This is the top.
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh?. You wanta go for a ride?
You did what?
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
Do you know you were humming?
I was not.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Tonight's the night?
God, and I'm running late --
You're hoping to get a look at what?
The Statue of Liberty.
It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!
It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
I know...
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Relax.
What are you suggesting?
I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...
Hey, Iris, you okay?
Who?
Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.
What a session this has been.
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
No.
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
He is in love. His anger is gone.
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
The instruments are right, but you are not.  I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Yeah?
I came back 'cause you were here.
I can't!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
I'll come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
But he wants me to come!
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
What?
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
What are you talking about?
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Alright.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Alright. Where's the Met?
Believe?
Annie!
One more time.
No, that's bad management.
Yes, people make me restless.
Even women?
There aren't any women here.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
And you're all alone.
Yeah.
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
That seems likely.
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, will you?  Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. It's the Evening Star. He'll be waiting. I'll take care of this.
Well... I did.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
What is it about the wrong kind of man? In grade school it was guys with earrings. College, motorcycles and leather jackets.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Thank God.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Oh.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Thank you.
Why?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Oh?
I was in the Army too.  And I'm good with crowds.
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
Thanks...friend.
Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
That sounds pretty interesting...
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
And it's hard to get.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
Where is he?!
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
I'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child?
That!?!
What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
No.
Sugarballs?
No.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
I have a cinnamon bar.
You do?
You can have half.
Put it in your mouth.
If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
No, no, that one.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
Yes...
He asked you not to grieve...
... Yes...
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... The needs of the few...
... Or the one.
... Spock...
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
Hey Jeff.
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
Nooooo!
Me?
How much?
About twenty-four thousand.
It was more than that last week.
Yeah.
Here's twenty-five thousand.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
You are married, correct?
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Impossible.  She was on the onramp.
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
You know it.
I'll give you back the 600.
I don't want your money.
I'm wearing, Archie.
There's two guns on you.
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
May be please have the wallet.
I like to watch.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
I want to tell Eve.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Yes.
Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Front page?
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
Me still. They left you alone?
I waited for you.
Why?
...I...don't know.
They do it each year.
I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
They'll love that.
Yes... well...
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
It's all right.
I don't even know this woman.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
My vacation is over in a week.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
Thanks.
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Right... Sorry, sir.
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
Best we move that pig.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
You do not look like me.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
No.  Course not.
Must it?
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Aint nobody out there, Mister.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
You a tourist?
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
Shut up Boyd.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
He's having a problem here.
Cunt.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
What?
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
I did keep an eye...
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now.
Where?
Seven homes along the Black River so far...
What can you do?
Nothing.
Oh, all that work.
It's nice to see you again.
Where is that?
In the Americas.
Well done, James.
We know.
Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
What?
Wait.  Wait.
Huh?
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Yeah.
Jesus...
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid."
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
Hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Why?
Well I don't want to do something like that.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
That's your fault not mine.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
So it's ok if I bring her.
Please don't.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
...please, I just don't want it....
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
I'm trying to be your friend.
I know.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Oh, Peter. A zit.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Mr. Gray?
That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
I'm always all business.
Ector.
What happened?
What are they?
They're eggs.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.

Oh, shit.
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
...Shift.
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
I think...
...we can make it.
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!

Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
I don't think we have much of a choice...
...do we?
Oh, shit.
That's right.  Now,  move!


Oh, shit.
 Okay.
Okay. 
ROW!
Sounds like it.
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.
Come in, Alfredo.
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
I'm so frightened.
I'll take you to a game.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
Act natural.
I was afraid you'd say that.
If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
Not like the others -- Dean, McCord, the rest ... We never got our side of the story out, Al.  People've forgotten.  I mean: "Fuck you, Mr. President, fuck you Tricia, fuck you Julie!" and all that shit, just words, but what violence!  The tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, Black Panthers -- we fixed it, Al, and they hate me for it -- the double dealing bastards.  They lionize that traitor, Ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's Nixon.  ... They've always hated Nixon.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
Don't hurry back.
Gray killed her.
We can't be sure of that.
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
Perhaps not.
I counted four.
I slept very well.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
May we proceed with the business?
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
It was stupid.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
I know.
How do you know?
Yes.
Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
Hey, look on the bright side --
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Well... at least now you know.
I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world.
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
Well, Dad said...
Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
Of course.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
No sir.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yes sir.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
Well I don't either!
I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.
He made that quite clear, yes.
Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind.
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
I'm looking at new cars.
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Good for you.  Good for you
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
Whattya mean?
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
So?
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
Did you know him?
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
Taken what?
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
Oh.  Ohhh?
What're you saying?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
They sure did! They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out.
The one up on the third floor?
Yes.
Uh huh.
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
Will that do?  No?
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
Who is it he reminds you of?
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
What do you mean?
The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Charge!
But only you will know he's not human.
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
Yes, John.
You did this for me?
Yes.
Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
What?
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
All right, you guys, shake hands.
I tried.
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
Give'em hell, sir !
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.
What?
That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject.
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Well, that kind of security can't be bought.  Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
There's nothin' to talk about.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Daphne, I...
What is it, Rico ?
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Good for you. Go find out.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Wussup, Victor.
Yo, can I talk to you for a minute?
Then you can go.
It's your turn!
I don't need a turn!
Mmmmm.
You like people?
They're okay.
Then why'd you do it?
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
Am I gettin' the car?
You're gettin' the car.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Eat my ass!
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Get a hold of yourself.
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
So we're working?
Good idea!
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
Hi, Louis.
... I thought it was the drug store.
Are you sick, Louis?
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Skeptical...?
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
The fish?
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
It works.  You should try it sometime.
The next time I walk into a bank.
Not usually this drunk.
Holly -- that's not so.
What! God damn, how many?
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Really?
Yeah, you don't remember?
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up!
They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Thanks!  That'd be great.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
But if we <u>haven't</u> caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway.
Why don't you get off his case?
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
Oh... I'm sorry...
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
So what does he want?
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
Revenge?  For what?
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
I don't know what you're talking about.
YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
Wouldn't bother me.
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
Don't worry.  I can handle it.
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
I got things to do.
Steve, stop it please...
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
Get out of here.
Come on! Quick! This way.
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
. . . Let me get my purse.
You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
I don't remember Zurich.
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
In the room?
In the world.
Your dead friend Jack?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
I was dreaming again?
I would think so.
Yeah, I would think so, too.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
Don't be so sure.
I was at home.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Yes.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
No.
Why don't we say we were together?
Why would we do that?
I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
What about it?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Our identification.
I'm doing okay, sir.
No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
He doesn't have anything to cut with.
Who!
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Loud.
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
I know.
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
Go on, answer him when he talks to you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.
Ooops.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Gentlemen--that's nice.
You startled me.
Hello, Eve.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Thank you, Eve.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
How is Ben feeling?
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
I know you do - you and your television...  ... Good luck, Chauncey.
Nothing.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Mike?
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Don't call me ever again.
Wow, I guess you were home... 
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
No es la verdad--[That isn't true--]
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
<u>Hector</u>.
Don't ask me.
You got it.
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
Why?
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
No you're not.
EXCUSE ME?
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
Jesus Christ!
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
You never could have kept this from me.
I was leaving.
That's probably a good idea.
Will you come with me?
I'm staying here.
What if I come back?
I'll hide.
No thanks.  It's not that far.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
I have five kids at home, I know how it works. I'm just not "it". Okay guys? Two fifty.
What do you mean?
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
So who else?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
Whadda you care?
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Yeah --
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
Go 'head.
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
How do you know? You know her that good?
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...
For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
Well, I -
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
I am.
So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?
Guess.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
You never told me your name.
My father didn't want it incinerated.
"No," what?
'Kay, Mac!
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
'Kay, Mac!
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
'Kay!
Shhh!
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
Please, just leave the car alone.
Yeah, you better remember that.
Not to be trapped.
You underestimate the trap, Mary.
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
No.
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes...
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
...as opposed to a print...
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ...
You bet.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner Sunday. With Kristen gone you'll be all alone.
The one you're wearing?
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
What?
I don't wanna see that.
Get used to it, babe.
Yes?
Do you know me?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Have we ever met?
Well, no.
Never?
Never.
That's what I thought. You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife.
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Why?
You don't have the stomach for it.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
I'm just not ready.
I doubt it.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
I can't thank you enough, I...
Sure, great if you ain't married.
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
So let's do it.
So what about him?
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Might be all right.
Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge?
Okay, Shorty.
Please.
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
What does she do?
She's an editor.
Mmm. An editor.
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
Can't I just go with you guys?
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
I need to see his habitat.
Can't you please finish your drink?
He is. Usually.
Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
No, Sid.
No. I'm here with you.
Probably not.
Yeah. Probably not.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
I'm glad I met you.
You're welcome.
...Not if I can help it.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
They'll mend.
What about your husband?
Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
Oh, but you have.  You undressed for me.  I kissed you.  I even touched your prick.  How will you be able to live with yourself?
I didn't finish talking to you!
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
Well, since, you're over twenty one
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
What do you mean?
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
All set.
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie
Yeah?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Okay.
What are you doing back?!!
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.
Over the Edge of the World.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
I read you, Captain. Let's have it.
I didnt requisition a secretary.
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
In his office.  I saw it this morning.
Bob...
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
Don't do this.
I'll lock him away for good.
Then we'll all go to jail together.
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
What?
Defuse the bomb.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
I know!
Let's get out of here!
GALE WATCHOUT!
Cynthia?
What?
How much time do we have?
Not enough, what do you want?
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
Can you hold it?
I don't know.
Just hold it, you'll be fine.
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
Charged?
Charged. Receiver?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And?
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
Oh yeah. Much better.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Half for doing what?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
And who watches your back?
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Yeah, if I can.
No!
A Nix specialty?
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
What didn't he tell you?
Didn't who tell me?
Burke.
What's Burke got to do with it?
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
Yeah, well I guess you should've.
What do you think of that? Or this?
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
What are we going to do?
Lucy.
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
-- a job.
Do I look that needy?
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
...that's all right.
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
Won't that mean you're dead?
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
Dixie McCoy didn't.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
It does look good.
Would you watch the damn road?
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Right.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
Who's up for making some real money?
He can't hear you.
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
Nothing. They're still there.
Right. Fine.
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
Yes, sir.
Have you been checked out?
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
Divinely?
No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
What?
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
Yes.
Now that is very interesting --  Take a chair, Joseph,
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Oh, a coastal city.  That's good.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
...OK.
Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
Is she?
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
Jack!  It's Christmas!
No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Why?
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
When did you decide?
It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
Yes.
It's so... small.
Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her.  And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out.  That's Paris, where my daughter was born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking.  So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang.  As if it never happened.  If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.
Uh -- what?
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
When all else fails, Jasper--Gum. Even now in these troubled times,                           ] every child's drug of choice.                               ]
What?
You're everything a guy could want.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
You think she was really there?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
 Shit. 
 Go on.
 Go, go.


Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!

No.  Shit.
Come on.
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay. 

Okay.
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
 Okay.  Okay. 
These'll keep it cold.
Yeah...
...yeah.
 Aw, shit  

All right, let's go.

Okay.  All right.  Okay. 

Hey, put it back!  We're takin' off.
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
Did I?
You don't remember that?
I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
You do?
I only dream about people who are dead.
Aha?
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Is this leading somewhere?
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Starting with a screw?
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
What about the explosive?
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Reed? ... Sue?
They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
Should I be?
Brides often are, I'm told.
I do not marry tonight.
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
Is he oily or dry?
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
-- Turn around.
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
What?
Did you hear what he said?
What?
He made, you know, a remark.
Honey, are you okay?
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
You'll think you're still at the convent.
Pheromones?
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
No.
Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
How?
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Then tell me what happened.
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
Love at first sight?
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Back where?
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Hear that, George?  Sally's actually taken to thinking of this clod of earth as her home.  And it's her first tour.  We're gratified, aren't we George?
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
Any of them hot?
Are those my Christmas presents?
Some of 'em.
Can I open 'em up?
Sure, go ahead.
Really?
In your dreams.
Dad!
You staying for dinner?
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
What?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
Go ahead.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
My office.
Right.
Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this... Said they should be afraid of him... I assume, afraid of what he could reveal.  Now, you tell me. What does this guy have to say that threatens these people?
I don't know you.
Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
He's rich.
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
He has a great body
Everybody has a great body now.
Sure ... fine.
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Like a tea ceremony?
No. Like this.
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
...to ride out and meet them.
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Still a bit chilly ...
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Have you any place in mind?
As a matter of fact I have ...
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
My time isn't up yet.
**?!! 
Newer, more powerful design.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
Where'd you get it then?
I stole it.
I believe you.
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Ah.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
I don't know. I can assume...
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
I'm not sure.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Video.
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
Yes, Your Majesty.
You can't.
What made you ask such a question?
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
I already apologized.
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.]
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
Why not?
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
No --
Tell 'em, Pop.
What about it!
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
Peggy Sue!
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Yeah, I guess you are.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
So what's your beef, pal?
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
It was you.  Downtown.
Eh?
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
All of what?
Of the deal, man.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
And that is?
What am I doing?
Then why send me back to them?!
Because I have to! 
I don't want to know...
I taught you that.
I can play the piano?
Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
Brady! Come with us.
Go!
Brady!
Get up there Rachel!
Yeah.  A great big one.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Okay, Fireman.
He's an enemy soldier.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
We're at war.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
I was beautiful then.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
But you would not stay with me.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
She was not as beautiful.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
We had no children.
You had a son.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Where is he? My son.
I killed him when he was born.  This place is my punishment.
You've got to help them.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
... I will.
Then <u>I'll</u> help them.  For a price.
Who was talking about what?
Jujitsu.
Same thing, isn't it?
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
What's the difference?
One's a lot more painful than the other.
Just... I have to.
And I want to know where.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
Where are you going?
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
The Albacore Club.
It has to do with my father.
I know.
He owns it. You know?
I saw him.
You saw my fa... father? When?
This morning.
You didn't tell me.
There hasn't been a lot of time.
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?
He's my brother.
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
More lies.
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!
Yes, sir!
Yes.  The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
I thought you'd missed the train.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
Is Freddie here?
He's downstairs.
I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
Incestuous.
Every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake.  What's wrong, Kittle?  You don't swing?
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
Shock.
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
You bet.
Okay. Thanks.
Get oacK on their tail.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
Put Kelly on too.
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
It would be interesting to find out.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
That's great.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
What are you scared of?
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Eww. No. That's gross.
It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
Easy, Billy, just open it.
Time will tell.
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Would you cool it already?
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying...
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
Fine!
You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
Good night.
I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these.
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
Well make it your business.
I don't remember.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
And the bodies?
You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
Nothing.
You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
Goodnight, sweetheart.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
--see?--
--I'm trying--
--fifteen phone calls--
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
Why didn't we get that?
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
--you do?--with access to records?
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
What?
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
What are you saying?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
You think they sold me out? No way.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
My brother blacksmiths!
That's right.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
You can't let Erik do THAT.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Yeah, okay.
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
Michael.
What?!
Come here a minute.
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Where?
Down there. That little one there.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Tis not fit for a princess.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I have no wife.
Then, perchance you'll me.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
Mm.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
And that is?
Because it's there.
Ah, Captain?
MM.?
I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
I know...
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
I never thought he'd do it.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
I guess so.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --
Which brother did this?
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
I love my brothers.
No you don't.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
You never asked them about it?
Are you serious?
Not ever?
Not ever.
You know my back.
What the fuck is going on there?
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
Easy, Dude.
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
...Fine.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
...I'm sorry.
Ain't your fault -- Here's the problem.
Danny!!!
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
No?
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Property.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
Lenin's Tomb.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Who is this?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
Anybody want a peanut?
My eye, is there something in my eye?
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
They come. They come and pushed me off.
Well, how much would you like?
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
I have?
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Am I what they had in mind?
They're going to love you.
There are always notices going up.
The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Youre drunk.
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?

Why?
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Don't talk nonsense.
He wants to kill US!
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Good strategy.
Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe.
That's bullshit.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
She's fine.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks.
Would you please go and look?
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
Why did you?
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
'Been up north?
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
No.
Well, it ain't that good up there neither. Might as well make it here. 'Course I ain't really makin' it now.
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Why aren't you on board?
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
To you, sir?
I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
Yes.
But I don't know anything about programming.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
I can't believe you're doing this.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What are you then?
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
It's a question.
She got the child labor stuff from me.
I think they'd understand.
That's not the point!  They need me!
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
No, and neither were my men.
Why?
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
To show them to the UN, right?
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
Peter keeps asking me out.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
I'm a junior.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
Would you tell her Bobby's here?
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
Just a hunch.
Ahm.....
What?  What?
Personally?
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
What Get Away jet?
It was in the Herald.
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
No.
The last one, please.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
You're compulsive.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Why's that?
Long story. Not that interesting.
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
Oh, God...
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
I don't drink.
It's for your finger.
One moment.
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
History, man, history. How much?
Two kilos.
Where?
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
Twenty months?
Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
It's a crime.
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
No.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
Yes.
Just now...
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes.
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
I . . ..
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
I...yes.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
I...
You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names.
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
Good.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Yes, of course, we --
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
I won't quit !
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
Fuck him!!!
...Be gone!!
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
...from this creature of God!!!
Oh, my God!!
Superior numbers, kid!
Fuck Maxine.
We wish.
I want to see Pilgrim.
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
I hope I'm not intruding?
Be my guest. What you got?
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
All right. I'm looking for a young fella, full of juice. About my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig.
Let me check.
There's no other way, boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
Well done.
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
Quite touching.
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Alright.
No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
You... Fuck you!
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
That's right.
I see.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Lydia.  Try to be civil.  I'm going to see if I can set up a noise-free zone in the study.
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
In love?  With who?
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Shut up.
Does it hurt?
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
Buddy, you're just a child.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
Well, nothin'.
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
It gets worse.
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
Then don't.
What?
With a bag of marshmallows.
Why?
Why what?
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
Yes...?
INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard ...Can I have a word?
What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
Nah...
Here have some of this. Won't feel a thing.
Can we go now?
It still worked in town.
I mean the armchair!
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
Rachel's job is she works.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Yes...if you like big hair...
Mommy?
What honey?
If you want me to hate her I will.
Yep.
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
Yes on all counts.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
You need to get out more.
C'mere, I want to show you something.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
What?  What does that mean?
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
Might of been before my time.
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
Yes?
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
I don't understa--
You always been this stubborn?
... Sally?
I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
Believe you're right.
That from the lock?
Flip six, three hole.
What ?
High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
What does?
The dark inside me.
His name is...
I'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
We have to get off this beam!
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
Go? Where?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
You'll wait till you rot!
Yes.  Barney!
Okay, okay.  I think.
What's 'at?
I said, the old man's screwy!
Yeah!
The dame's too smart for him.
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
Sir?
My suitcase is gone.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy.
Fine. You got five...
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
Hold it!
What are you saying?
Thank you.
Earl Williams. The reprieve.
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Last week would this be?
Let me borrow your car.
May I be blunt with you?
If you must.
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Right.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
What are you thinking about?
I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
And an R.C.
Nothing.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
What?
Is this yours? Your pen?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
He suggested I ask you.
Ask me?
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
I wanted to meet your brothers...
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
You want to get into this now?
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
Mammoth.
The Gazette's small huh?
Well what?
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
Say the Word!
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
Uh - - about two million.
Two million - - great.  That would help.  Oh good, that'll take no time.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.
Then it went well.
Did it really go well?
Define your terms.
Do you feel good about it?
No.
Do others feel that you did well?
No.
Then what was good about it?
I lost six pounds...
Aaron, will you tell me?
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
People phoned in.
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
I'm not kidding.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
I have to be somewhere.
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
Yeah...
Pregnant.
No, no, that's impossible.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
The Army can hang him.
Tomorrow.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Did you get his number?
I know who it is.
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
I still don't understand --
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
Excuse me ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
Is this really the time ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
He hired you to build this place ?
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
You mean my problem?
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
I don't know.
That's not a helpful answer.
That's my answer.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
What?
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
Ask Sal.
Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here?
They went on like I told you.
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Why do you keep saying that?
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Oh, him.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
What?
We'll cover it later.
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
We need to get past them.
I'll be all right.
You're my brave boy.
Ain't gonna be moved?
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
Or what?
I told you to TURN BACK!
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
Mitchell?
No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
It's still a little early for me.
So be it.
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Four bits.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Yeh.
I try not to expect you.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
You wouldn't come to find me?  That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
If you say so.
Not much point to this, is there?
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Mm.
So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --
Next week.
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
He told me he had done two others just like it.
When was that?
When he was seventeen.
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Yes.  I believed him.
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
I'll make it.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
No it's not.
Why did you take the back roads here?  They're not safe.  You'd know that if you'd planned.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
Did you see who posted it?
How do you do?
Well I just uh, you know...
Sixteen times.
We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...
Now the lady said you may go
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
Yes.  Of course.  But, I'm talking about that ring.  It's something else.  Let me tell you.
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
Yeah, I guess.
America... She iz a beetch that sheets on her own children.
They used to hang people here.
Done.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
Will you stop.
I don't know.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
Yes.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
I was trying to protect you from this...
Right here!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Why?
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Yes.  Well... yes.
Right.
It works a little.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
You do?
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
Kill him! He's the one!!
Not me, idiot - HIM!
... that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
What?  Jesus, tell me!
It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
He was nervous.
What.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
Oh... um, William.
It's a nice name.  William, I'd like you to meet David.  David... William.
Excuse me?
I hear youre looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leons gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
Uh-huh.
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
I take it you dont know where he is, then?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you?
I know his work better than I know him.
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just aint worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of em.
What about his girlfriend?
What about which girlfriend?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Would you know where I might reach her?
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I dont really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. Thats how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
Could that be Camden Market?
Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Fucked-up fucking weird.
Is Spanky here?
No, but...
Then what's the problem?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Yeah...
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Sharp.
I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Like what?
Travel...and things.
Run it down.
Okay. Then you can be of use.
That light.
I don't know. I think it's the moon.
Yes.
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
What you see is what I got, mister.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
Keys.
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Huh?
Open up the trunk.
Yes, sir.
Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.
Oh, yes.
Will I be seeing you again?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Oh. That. Rome.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Without any clothes on?
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, but...
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Yes.
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
So you didn't go to school together.
No.
And you didn't come up here to see her.
No.
You were lying.
Yes, I was lying.
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
I wrote the letter.
What did it say?
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
But you tore it up.
Yes.
Why?
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I told you what happened in Rome!
Do you expect me to believe...?
I don't give a damn what you believe!
Good idea.
How about I go right, sir?
How about you take your position?
Maybe not to your face...
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
He's an asshole.
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
Shut it. It's Ma.
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
Lily!
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
We need an exit.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
We're on our way --
Someone else has it now.
That would indicate that it's the future.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
You are here and there is no place to go...
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.  IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE.
What do you know about it?
As much as ever.  Nothing.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
The hospital.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
Have fun at work.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
Shut up.
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
Yes, probably... maybe...
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Yes, but...
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
No, I... I held it up to...
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
No, I... I never killed anyone!
Get your goddamn--
My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
I think two million.
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
I need you to stake me.
Stake you?
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
Wait a minute ...
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
What are you saying?
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
Huh?
That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.
You don't think we're going to make it.
I didn't say that.
You didn't have to.........
I just need you to be safe.
What about you?
What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.
Can I have the reception desk, please.
Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
Come here.
Where?
Her?
It's a thought I had.
Should I open it now?
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
Put somepin' over him, so he won't git sun-struck.  Ever'body set now?  Awright, Al, letta go!
Check!
You look different... More relaxed.
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
He believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now.
So what do you make of it?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
It's all yours.
There's more.
Just stop.
Just giving the facts.
I'm calling the police.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
Still needs work.
You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
Sandra Sinclair.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
I wanna close up soon.  C'mon, let's call her.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.
...things change.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I'm sure you would.
I -- no, I --
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
Yes.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
Dudley.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
Dudley's guys.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
That's so weak.
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
Honey, she won't d...
I see.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Yes. It's a very good show.
I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Nashville.
Oh... Well.
The car broke down.
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
Next you'll be sick.
I feel really good.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
I don't know his first name.
Bet the sheets are grey.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
Fungus?
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
I don't think so.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
How do you know if they do?
Care to join me?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Yes.
Sweet dreams, Blake.
You sound shocked or something.
I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
I wouldn't know.
Surely --
What I do, I do for my Queen.
Was there never ambition?
Maybe, once.
Then I envy yo.
Why?
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
I do what I do.
For Her Majesty.
Aye.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
I said.  I serve the Queen.
No other aspiration?
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
None.  Christ!
You're not even coming?
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window.
Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
That's the last thing they took from me.
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
I likes yellow.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
You saying nothing counts?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Not like He punished me.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Was a time I knew what was.
You still know.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
Aw, Baby.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
What?
Shoot the radio!
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
He is the Destructor.
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
What?
Between six and seven seconds.
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
What happened to "degrees"?
I didn't kill him --
Then who did?
Sure. Any time.
And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink.
Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
It was one incident.
Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
How do we do that?
Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
We're very evolved.
Aye!  Avast!
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
What's your father do?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Be tough on 'em.
Cunnilingus?
Wait!... Wait...
Into what?
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
I love her.
You do, you don't.  She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it.  Don't you see?  No, you don't.
Does anyone want another?
You want another drink?
A third party?
Yes. The John Doe Party.
I... I... I...
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
Not yet.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Can't it go to any office?
No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.  I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road.  And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  I'll have to tell you the code.
It's a roach, guy --
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
Oh, man --
Bob.
Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved.
What are you gonna talk about?
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
Then why are you putting on mascara?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Or blush.  You look pale.
What do you mean?
The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
Another drink please.
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
Oh my God.
It's good with coffee.
So's a donut.
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look.
What?
I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a quarter?
Six years ...
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
Tell me about Kip -
Maybe he melted.
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
Let's go down to the basement.
We'll take it!
You got it.  It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
Yeah, good.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Certain?
Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.
I hope there's a place to land.
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Huh uh.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
What if I keep dropping?
Not an option.
What if I do?
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
I don't believe you.
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
Drink up then.
Not you, Donna, not you.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
But what am I going to do?
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
I can't.    I can't see him there.
I know about Esparza.
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Then what is it?
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
Which is what?
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
So that's what love is?
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Those were my words, Bill.
Well, they're mine now.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
You're mad, aren't you?
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
The usual, you know. Uh, tryin' t' write. I'm workin' on a play.  Jesus. So whatta yuh saying? That you're not comin' back to New York with me?
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
The United Nations are still here.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
What did you overhear?
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
What did they say?
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
He gives a good report and I walk?
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
Often, uh.
How recently?
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
It's November.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
What about this Beetle guy?
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
But he's all right?
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Of course.
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
Bene.
I'll call tomorrow.
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
What? Ah yes. Of course. I'm sorry. It's just that...you're my idol.  And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
Yes, for your hair.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Wake up.  Make a right at Ocean Avenue.  The hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
Yeah. What about the second act?
That's taking place outside now.
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
Talk so I can understand.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
Then fix it.
Yeah.
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
What do you mean?
Who did you work with to get the--
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
Have you been working with Rachel?
No.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Did you need it?
Yeah.
Oh?
You are, aren't you?
Certainly, but...
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
Who's she?
Don't know. Who is she?
You're a genius.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
How do you know?
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
What about the other one?
They're still looking for him.
Who's got the contract?
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Hackers.
They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed.  They figure maybe he skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em up?
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Mandarin. You jerk.  I'm late. I have to get dressed.
Why what?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.
What's the assignment?
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
Oh yeah.
He filmed his victims.
Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
FINE. Are you?
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
What?
Mark invited me to the party.
What party?
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
No.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Nope. No complaints.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Must be the Spring.
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
No. No. It's too good a story.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Yeah?
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Um. You're doing all right.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Santa Claus?
KingKing Westley was in it.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Thanks, professor.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
What if you're trying to be something you are? The hell with Donovan. Stay.
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
No. I mean work work.
Well, what can you do?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Extra?
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
No..No that won't do...
Why not?
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
It's not your fault.
Hear, hear...
You found Buckley?
Up.
Up ribbon!
You hate Raoul?
Sometimes.  And sometimes I don't--  Shut the fuck up!
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Not in the eyes of the law.
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
I guess not.
Do you want me to stop?
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
What do you mean?
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
I don't want to go back.
What do you want to do?
C'mon.
You think I got any kind of a voice?
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
What is it?
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
We forgot to stop at the store.
You have something to say about everything....
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Call the police?
Instantly.
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
She can't talk right now.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
How'd you get to know so much about him?
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
You're twenty-three years old!
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
We didn't have sex.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
You use the word "fucking." You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex.
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
Exactly. When we get into the clearing, I'll turn on my sexy moves. Wichita will go for it or he'll shoot me down.  Either way, you come away with knowledge.
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were in the m- You were in the building.
I was in the building!
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
No, you're not in my class.
I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
Not too far, I hope.
This badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk.  It is not a thing you can give up as of no value.  It may be taken from you--and you may die defending it. But you'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with.  It's a naked steel of the sword of Justice.  Put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it--and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now.
Leaving the room.
Leaving the room ... yes.
Got it?
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
The things that get you excited.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
What are those mirrors for?
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
The what?
The City Sealer's office!
You mean here in the city?
Yes, yes!
Get back!  Now!
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
I think he's really angry with me too.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
I'm sorry.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
That's a lot of those.
Medallions.
A lot of cakes.
Yes.
And he doesn't smoke?
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
How long have you been married?
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
You must have been a baby.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
Come here.
Really?
Yes.  This one though is... very good.
Describe him.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
The shooter local?
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Not as bad as it looks.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
Trying to be.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.
If there was, I didn't see it...
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Go and ask him yourself.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Mom?
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
My error.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
Now what?
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
But you said we could be together.
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
But I want to say with you,
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
I think you're a lying, back stabbing bitch.  But it's nice to know you care.
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.
You got something on the coke?
No -- but I got something.
Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
What?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Do you still have friends on the force?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
What makes you think I could do that?
You were a cop.
What makes you think I would do that?
I'm your son.
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
Eric!
Dad, we're well out of range.
Oh nothing.
Tell me.
No. It is too judgmental.
Tell me what he said.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
Outstanding.  Princess...?
Why not?
I don't know.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
You fuckin' rule!
Yeah.  It was great.
Guess I'm just lucky.
That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
You may step down.
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
Winning?
Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
This isn't a request.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
The situation has changed.
That so?
Aye.  See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?
No. Fred hates them.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Yes.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
Yes.
We conclude our transaction.
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
Did what?
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
There is.
Even your play.
Oh
And that was only my first try.
Well perhaps better than my first. 
I think he's dead!
Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
We had a description of the suspect.
A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
The river is beautiful.
It's a double.
Even better.
Even cosier.
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
You really think that's what happened?
I don't know but it makes one hell of an opening statement.
Why?
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Did Sidney tell you about it?
Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this boy too well.  Anything in these charges?
C'mon, Tommy --
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Never felt better.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
He should.
This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Why not go to work for me?
Doing what?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Yes.
She took the baby in her arms?
Yes.
You saw it all didn't you?
Yes.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
We could...
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
Oh, great.
Yes.
About who?
I fantasized about you.
About me?
Yes.
All right.
Right here.
I read, Cooch.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
Good.
They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
We gonna fuck or what?
Shh, shh...  "They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them"
Thank you.
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
...nightmare.
What's up...?
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
Yeah, so where is he?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
They got that kind of money?
Their family owns...
Hello.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this  believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I  I'm sorry - listen, how are you  I'm sorry. You doing okay?
...Who is this?
Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
Nothing.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
As opposed to this T.V.?
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
[Who are you?]
[I am the President of La Hermanidad.]
Why not you?
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
It is a favor, isn't it?
According to you, yeah.  Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty!  I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds.  Also, since we're talking repulsive, J.J. won't like this for two cents!  Don't give me that look, Dallas - J.J. believes in fair play.  And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend!
My equipment doesn't crap out....
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
You are?
Yeah, come on, let's talk.
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
I'd love it!
Why?
I don't have any idea.
Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom.  All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here. Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it.  Look at the walls in the closets.  The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere.
No, thanks, I can manage.
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
I'm sorry.
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
I'm sorry.
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
Just wait till you hear...
Hear what?
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
When?
Yesterday...
Who told you that?
Gary Blinker...
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
How would you describe him?
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
Sugar?
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
I know how he found me.
It's called a transponder.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
Not that way.
Not any way.
Took me about three hours.
I been immobile.
No. You don't understand.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
Have what?
Did she tell you anything?
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache...
I don't know.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
I leave it to you.
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Twinky?
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
A wig?
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
Come where?
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
Go right ahead, sir.
Break a leg.
Yes.
Check.
Leave me alone, Jude.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
I heard.
Eddie and Tinker died.
I know.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
Suits you.
Nothing.
Experience!
They're mesmerising.
It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
Who?
The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
Tha's your problem.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Huh?
Asshole.
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
It's cool... but,I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana, ...   and John's using hair products... I don't know who I.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Two and a half cents.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
Which way is House 25?
Classy.
You did?
I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
That's it.  My life.
Um-huh.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
I'm glad.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I don't follow you.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
Okay...
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
I think so.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
What was that?
Transference!
Transference.
Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...  ...that I am in love with you.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
We're going all the way.  Together.
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
Easy black boy.
It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
Sure.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
What about?
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.
Apple core?
Yeah.
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
No ... just keep him in here.
Until you, or anyone else ...
No, not anyone else - just me.
Just you ...
Mrs. Robinson?
Yes?
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Can you look through the glass.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
It must have slipped my mind.
Your mind is so slippery.
Don't worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days are over. You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole.  We're such an incredible team. Who could possibly stop us? 
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
I fixed it myself.
Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
We should sign her to a talent holding deal. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- FRANCES' ROOM -- NEXT
I know.
You know.
I know the guy leaves a sign.
Tell me again.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
I don't understand.
Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.
Yes, Osgood?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
What's up?
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
He's doing the interview with the lady --
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
What happend?
Doc, go get Frank and put him on the phone.
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
One that looks nice.
Of course.
And not too expensive.
Yes ...
Now - go!
I'm Josephine.  Sax.
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
Oh God.
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
Yes.
Tell me, how do you do that?
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
I'll tell you why!
You want something off the B list?
Yeah.  Yeah.
Not exactly according to plan.
Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
But you hate each other!
What's a little hate between business partners?
Alice?
Nancy!
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
You're not the Mayor.
Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
Running blocker.
Shit!
Yes.
Well, then what are you doing here?
I... do you want me to leave?
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
I...
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Who told you that?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
And what makes you so tough?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...
If I don't 'grow up...'
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
You, you don't under...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
It's over!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What is that to you...?
What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
I don't know.  I lost him.
I'm okay.
Correct.
You damn well thought wrong.
I'm terribly sorry old man.
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Four.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
I never said that.
We're on the move.
C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Fine  you want to stay here?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
His girlfriend?
Yes, his girlfriend.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
Yeah.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
No. She's probably scared to death.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Maybe.
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
No.
When was the last time?
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
There is only three of us here.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Plank?
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
Where?
Outside Adele's.
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
What's going on, Glenn?
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
And is Foley a part of this?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Why's that?
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Gee, I wonder why not.
I'm freezing my ass off.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Really?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
Then, I'll see you around.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.
I've got you!
You'll be sucked down too!
No! Arrgh!
I know what it is.
I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
No, no...Please.
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.
Got a shovel?
No.
There's probably one in the basement.
Now wait a minute --
Parry!
gives her a sympathetic look.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
looks startled at the outburst.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
Really.
Burn it to a fine ash.
For months... last October.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
How do you know that?
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Shoot.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Oh yeah?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Jeffrey!!
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Yeah.
Jeffrey? Why?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
You like mysteries that much?
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
Enough!
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
What is this place, Merlin?
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
You're certifiable.
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Believe you about what?
"Hell!"
No -- neither do I. But...  but this man is a Christian and he has written --
It's unbelievable.
Think of it! In times like these.
Say, what about that gold deal?
Huh?
Gold. You were going to
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
All right.
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
I'm not letting go of him.
How do you know?
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
I want the rest of the pictures.
What pictures?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
I heard it was an accident.
C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Why are the shutters closed?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Bunch of savages in this town.
That's what I said.
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
Does it work on cash machines?
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
No way! He just called him a dick.
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
No. Look.
These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
Victor, are you feeling alright?
You don't remember?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
You've been out for about a day.
Say what?
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
What a nice compliment.
Maybe he isn't alone.
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
I feel sure of it.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
She was ...
Thanks.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Sometimes.
Such things have happened before, sir.
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
And you got some Italians -- ?
Six or seven...
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
I understand -
Eat Cheerios.
You eat Cheerios.  I want Fruit Loops.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
How about, nice to see you?  Glad you're here to save my life.
I know.  Help me get a sample.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
To where?
Go on.
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
Talk? Once, at a gathering, he put his hand over a candle. And he kept it there. He kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared. A woman who was watching asked, "What's the trick?" And he replied. "The trick is not minding."
I don't have a choice.
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
We're going to have to reconfigure.
How long?
At least a day.
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father?
Mmm...
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
You're so gross.
She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
Ha ha...
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
No need to thank me, if you don't want to.  Just pay for these drinks.
Always.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
Happy for him.  And relieved.
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
Understood.

Not with the Romulans.

Just lucky, Admiral.
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
What are you talking about?
Fred Krueger did it.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
May life be good to you both. As for the others  they will be quiet here  and I will be with them.
Oh, Jesus.
What name?
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Why?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Why?
I don't know. That's all I was told.
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
Please let me go with you.
No.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
The what?
Save your...
Zuzu  Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Fine.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I still don't think it's loaded.
Okay sure. What about?
Its about tonight.
No you didn't.
Oh yeah. Had you big time.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
Wait a minute.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.
Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
Do have any idea what I just said?
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Do they have pressure?
Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
She didn't write to me, did she.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
You're not a failure, Dick.
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
I beg your pardon?
Technically, I'm number one.  I went out with her a week before Kevin did.  Her first boyfriend.  Me.
No way... GET OUT!!!
Say it!... I'LL TEAR YOUR FUCKIN' HEART OUT, GIRL... Say "fuck me" soft - then I'll leave. Say "fuck me"... Whisper it... Then I'll leave... Say it... Say it - Say it - Say it...
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
No, that's true.
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
Wladek, please.
Just a little experiment.
Oh no, nothing for me.
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
Jesus, I don't believe it.
Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
There is no news big enough.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
Yes
Why? Do you enjoy it?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
How can you? I mean they're people.
I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason.
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
Yeah, I do.
I want to believe you, too.
What do you mean?
Just gimme a chance.
Git.
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
And after that?
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
I knew this was going to happen.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes.  You meet someone, you move in, she goes.
You see the bullet?
Clearly.
Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
What do I do?
Relax. Let me do this.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
Right here, baby.  Right here.
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
You might be disappointed.
Why?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
No.
Liar.
I can't.
Jacques, take me back down... Please.
And the other one -- he is like you?
He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me.  We are the last of our kind.  The last of the Calans.  I do not know what purpose we were put here for.  I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
Swann's wife.
The Core...!
Who is it raped you?
Nobody.
Well, what's the beef?
Really.
I mean, romantically.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
My hands?
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad.
Honey?
Mm.
Well, a little.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
Well, yeah.
Please yourself.
Its my job.
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
No trouble at all.
Yes.
Will you tell him?
I don't know.
Agnes... Agnes...
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
Who?
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
And people are actually fooled by that?
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
It's not real...  That's not me.
Oh, please--
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Stacy--
Leave this house.
<u>Pay</u> her.
I don't got the money.
Find the money.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
What for?
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Why... 
Yes?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Yes.
How do you know Annie?
We... we went to school together. College.
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
Oh, no you don't!
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
So everything you just said --
I'm a man who knows what I want.
Hmm, nice.
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
No. I am a "tubab."
What do you mean?
Tubab means white man.
Suez.  1956.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
All right.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
What about the Cromwells?
They don't count.
You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
No... She's fine. Back home.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Set one up.
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
... Nothing.
A letter.  May I see?
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
Lemme talk to him.  Shoe?  Shoe...?  You in there...?
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
Maria?
Yes, the little Russian girl.
What's she got to do with it?
She's going with me.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
How can you know this?
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
Um-hum.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
TATUM!
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
Sammy's?
He still having parties?
He never stopped.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Billion.
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
A Jewish prayer.
Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer?
Thank you.
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
I do believe you.  That's what I want everybody to believe.  Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
How?
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Putty? On both doors?
There's something else kinda interesting...
You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand?
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
No.
Well... try the headset.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Theramin.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
But what if Sarris survives?
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
But how would we pay our bills?
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Socially... I'll have a beer.
So you admit you just lied?
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
Okay -- up there.
No, you may wait behind the screen.
First Nagasaki--now this.
How about breakfast, wife?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Good word.
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
We took a walk three days ago.
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
What was cold about it?
That's unkind.
Come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy?
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
No, trust me, you want to take this call.
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
....getthat on the tv....there...
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
Did anyone stand out?
What do you mean, stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
What was suspicious about him?
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
Yes, it is.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
Good.
But --
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Okay then.
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
I want them arrested and hanged!
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
This is no game.
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
I don't know.
The girl strikes like a cobra.
The Dancing Dingus!
The Jerky Circle!
Maybe Hawaii.
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Jake, I mean, come on --
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
He heard.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
And therefore?
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
The year 2027?
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
And listen--watch out about the pals you choose--Know what I mean? Don't let them choose you--
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
Son of a bitch!!
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
He was?
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
You dog! I didn't see you go back there.
You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
Uh-huh.
Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
This could go on for hours.
So you're staying in tonight?
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
Come back tomorrow.
I'll wait for him.
Why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  Ever been booked before?
He says he feels safe here.
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
Yeah...a lot.
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
There's something I haven't told you...
No! Should I?
What about the trees?
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
I no from around here.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Nope.
Just stay there, Nell!
You messed with the evidence.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
Listen to me, Hooker.  What ever you do, don't go back to your place tonight, don't go anyplace you usually go, ya hear me?  Get outa town or somethin', but...
You killed him...
It's gonna be o.k.
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
What guy?
Randy somebody.
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
Hi Wendy.
What are you doing here?
You've got a call.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
Fewer will survive them.
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Bullshit.
Look in my pack.
Why?
Just look. Little pocket.
I know, everyone says that.
Yeah.
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
Now I know...
He's having an early night.
Poor man.  We were knocking on that door for ever.  I think I've broken my strap.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Carrie.
I don't want to talk about it.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
... Hello.
No. I'm going with you.
Are you Herr Mozart?
That's right.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
What?
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
... What's going on?
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
Let me rephrase that...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
... except one.
I know.
<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
One more time!
I will be with thee straight.
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
This play?
Yes, and acting!  It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives.
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
So, we're talking money laundering...
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.
--and The ass of The man who adores her.
Yes it does.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
I can't win with you.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
I do not.
Lighten up.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Fine.
Hello.
She fucked me.
She fucked me too.
She fucked you?
She fucked me too.
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Of course.
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
Look, man, did you--
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
All right, I owe you one Marv.
That's right, next time a little birdie talks to you, talk to me too E.F. Hutton.
No -- not this time.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
-- Listen to me --
I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
Thank you.
Sure!
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
A voice ...
That spoke to you?
That called ... commanded ...
What did it say?
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
I am an expert!
You're a teacher.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
Their people?
They're only taking the whites.
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
They were yellow!
You're color blind.
You won't be alone for long.
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
It was you!  I thought I heard...
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
Allen?  He... he's okay?
I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
I never heard of him.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
I said I never heard of him.
Is she not here?
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
You can't show intent.
That's all right, really, thank you.
All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?
What did it say?
A thousand things.
You're hurting my head.
What can we do against them?
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
Maybe so.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Don't tell me what to think.
Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.
Why call me?
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
Money?
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
I love those doors.
Where will you live?
The garage.
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
When's school over?
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
No. No.
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
You gotta drive!
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
No.  Can you get a man close?
Oh, my God.
No, he doesn't.
Are you sure?
You saw the ad in the Times?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
There was no ad in the Times.
What's the matter with Bjorn?
So?  So?
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
Betty was a lovely child.
I know this part, keep reading.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
Just her name.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
Nothing.
It was the nightmare man
What?
He's coming to get me Rachel.
I believe I have.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
No, don't think I do.
Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
Yeah.  No, not really.
Let's work it.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
He records himself raping and killing her--
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
So've I.  Too much.
But this is a bad one.
Top ten.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
Finish the job...
And now...
Finish it!
Never a good thing.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Really.
Yes.
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
You scored with two chicks?!
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
Certainly. Right over there.
You're all right.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
Maybe he doesn't care about that.
What do you chant?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
I don't remember saying yes.
I don't remember you saying no.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Yeah.  Right.
Are you crazy?
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
WHY?
Because I'm going to get my father!
Gabe.
Is that what you think?
I'm just making a point.  You have no idea what you're asking.  How much trust two people need to do something like this.
...why do you think?
Because it feels really incredibly good.
I will not fight you.
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
Christ, what...
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
Jack, you're wrong.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
Jack...
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
What is it my son?
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
God's permission? God doesn't...
I think so... They're just... So ...
I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --
What is it?
Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
You aren't angry with me?
Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing.
So?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Why'd he do it?
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
I don't know where that is.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay. 
Okay, come on down.
I will.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
Here?
Now. Show now.
Sorry for what?
I should have done this a long long time ago.
You feelin' sick?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Yeah, I know.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
But don't you stay in El Paso?
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
I don't know.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
They're truck drivers.
The strain was evident.
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
Okay.
One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
Hah!
Just him, sir!
Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station!
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
You need to lighten up.
Can't you give me something?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
Nothing.
Hes going to insert the plutonium.
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
Thorough man.
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
Wait a second. He knows I know.
Hey.
You got a dog?
It's not ours.  It's George's.
Yeah.
Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
You guys know more about that than I do. I just fight...
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Luther was part of the gang?
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
Not anymore.
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
One to seven: Deal the face cards.
Don't.
Watch out!
Satan.
Ah.
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
Same all around! For my friend, too!
Yes.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
You did? A human ear?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Let me talk to him.
No.
You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
... A hundred and eight?
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
Well, there's a lot to be said for that.  And I'm going to show a clip.  You've seen it before, you've seen it <u>many</u> times...  But I'm going to ask you to look at it once more.  With the election one day off, and the President's standing in the polls...
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
Catch?
This is a knock.
Nor did you, I noticed.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
Exactly.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
What's your plan?
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Well. I stand corrected.
Tell you what...
Have you seen Day-Day?
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
That's what gives me The Fear.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
Not much. Why?
I have to go.
GO?
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
Can we make it?
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
I want to leave fast.
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
Do they pay you to screw that bear?
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
How did I look?
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Well... you're looking well.
Anything.
Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
Freezing.
Come here.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Well?
Sir. I was going Mach point one five.
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
And now you wanta teach me?
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
I doubt that.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
Annie, I think you should leave.
Yes.
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
They are washed.
That all depends on you.
Why are you doing this?
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
I will not have this in my home.
I just want to understand--
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
I don't want you to--
There is nothing to understand but this:   I am a man who could have been great, but was not.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
You're practically naked!
I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.
OK, get in.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
Take any three you like. After you get settled we can...
Truman used it all the time.
I heard that.
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
He'll turn around.
He won't.
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I don't know.  That's the point.
Everything can be killed.
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
It's not the gas, Dad!
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
Is it a good morning?
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
I've done that before.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
Burke them?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
I come from Lisbon.
But still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets.
Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Dick-weed.
Butt-munch.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
I'm not sure but look. . .
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
I don't agree with you.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
You would.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
Then marry Ralph ... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
You better start making sense!
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor.  You needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone, jettisoned. Save for one.
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.." The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  Doctor, if you please.
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
You do - repeatedly.
Do I snore?
I'm very aware of that.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say?  If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory.
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
Look, I...
Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart.
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Let's get away from the shore.
No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Awww. That was so cute.
Excuse me?
Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
The principal.
Wow.
Sue me.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Lydia.  What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  Go help your mother.
No!
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Not bad. You?
Eleven and a half.
Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
My dad.
It works?
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
What?
He's right. You were behind.
-- Oh yeah.
But then again you ask for it -- you just like my Otis -- can't keep his hands outta ladies' hair either.
Nothing.
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
After your parents passed away?
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
He has a computer?
Sure.
In the house?
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
May I please be excused?
Uh...yeah.
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Thank God this plate was already fixed.
Not bad, huh?
You're a... you're sick.
What's wrong with me?
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
So you do eat pussy!
Naw naw!
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
We've got a nice plant here.
Huh?
Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
Dead and gone.
I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
You got it, sir.
Probably no longer than four weeks.
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
Well, it's still a good idea.
I know, honey.  Me too.
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
Thanks.
Eight o'clock?
I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
That was the same thing Ray said.
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
I have some friends who have had a accident--
You have somebody else out there?
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
We was crossin' the river--
Do you think I was faking?
If I did-I don't-now.
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
Yeah.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Sure. Why not.
Where? Where is he?
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
You talk to him?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
What hospital is he in? Where?
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick!
[What is his name?]
[Daniel.]
[Daniel what?]
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
Yeah.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
Suspect Zero?
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
So you went underground?
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
I don't carry it with me.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
"Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession..."
Don't do this... please...
Put the gun down, Somerset!
Give us a break...
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
I'm sorry, Walter.
Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
Is this your new dress suit?
Yes, Swana.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Yes, Swana, you did.
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Yes, Swana.
Am I interrupting?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
How do you do?
I don't know, Debo.
It's nice to see you.
Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
Nicholas...
We made it !
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
It's a school night... back by nine.
DON'T!!!
Uh oh...
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
...I dropped it.
In the tar??
It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.
For what?
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
I wouldn't bet on that.
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
-- Your act only works with an audience.
My act?!
And what am I?
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
Not likely, convict.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
Take it easy, Jake.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
Jake, for Christ's sake.
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
Uh...maybe?
'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!"
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Peter I love you too but...
I don't think you'll hurt me.
That way.
Any particular reason?
None at all.
We're being hailed.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
You're joking, right?
Not on that leg.
Take the gun.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
We could convert fission transistors.
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
Mary came with me.
Go to the water, it's that way!
Okay, Mom.
Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
No. I'm just a snoop.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
No, not for that one.
I don't believe you.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
Yes.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
No.    145 Ridgeroad Way.
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
Whose orders ?
Are you following me?
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
Intriguing?
He's *paralyzed*!
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
What do you want me to *do*?
What is it?
In private, if you don't mind...
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.
Just chill.
That's it?
Nah, we make out and stuff.
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
I believe so.
Yeah, we better.
I have a present for you. I didn't quite know what to get you -- anyway it's a little awkward for me, shopping --  -- so here's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something.
It's okay. We broke up.
When?
Just now.
Few days ago.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
Assa good idea, Pappy.
Whataya mean, no record?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
I'm worried about you.
About me?  How sweet.
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
Oh, please!
Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done!
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
He'll never do it.
I think he will.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
To what?  Trap him?
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
I haven't seen him in two years.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
What was he after?
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
I...I...
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Martins.
You a friend of Lime's?
Yes.
Been here long?
No.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage.
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
Relax, Baxter.
Thank you, sir.
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Let's get out of here.
What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
In a village called Domremy.
How old are you?
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Were you baptized?
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Not unless you hear my confession.
And what it that?
You speak for me, son.
How do you like it?
It's quite  nice.
How about another one?
No thanks... .
Hit me again, Mac.
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
What?
Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.
I don't want to hear it.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Please don't go there.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Do you have to be so damn forthright?
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
At church?
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
You gonna sing me somethin'?
When? Now? Oh. No.
Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
Proceed.
If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
Which one?
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Any planets?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Any of 'em any good?
Naah. All stable.
Thorgan? You coming?!
Something awful happened last night.
What do you mean?!
I... I don't think you want to know.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Does your mother know?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Why didn't you do something?
I don't know.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
Well... not exactly.
He made you give him a blow job.
No.
Well what then?
So I didn't fucking do it!
She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
Yes?... How was your journey?
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
Where.
In the jungle. 122nd.
Close -- but definitely wrong.
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
Thank you.
Shhh...
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
Sorry to disappoint you...
On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring...  to my blood...  ...than any imagining could possibly have been...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Please.
I hope so.
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
Maybe you want my money, too.
I...
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
The park dude was missing an arm.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
You have a right to be angry.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Like Custer huh?
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
Can there be some mistake?
Only if you're making it.
Hey, you okay?
I don't know.
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
What night?
Last time I saw you.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Whatiya mean?
You were acting like a different person.
I won't and nothing you say-
"The show must go on."
...Damn you!  Damn you!
I don't want to scare them away.
Try telling them our names.
Is there a phone booth there?
They all have one...
Go and look for a note.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
You will respect the law.
There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
But who is left?
I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
Yes.
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
Did you know the victim?
No.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
It doesn't.
He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
I slept with your sister.
Bunny.
Don't say a fuckin' word.
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
They still have to take it to a jury.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
... we've got a committee meeting.
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.  You gentleman can remain here, or...
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
You did?
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Over a girl?
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
No, I don't.
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Where?
Here.
In the knee?
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
That's terrible.
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
Of course not. Here's the fruit cake.  And you want to see my knee? 
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
Well--
Viewer, standard ahead.
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
What's that?
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Is that why you're still here?
Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
What are they?
To help you relax... please...
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
Yes, I gathered as much.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
Yes.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
Joey...
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
Joey...
Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again...
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
Put them all together and what do we have?
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
"Ay, there's the rub."  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
I want to go!
Where?
I want to go back to Vienna.
Now?
Yes!
Why?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
What are you talking about?
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
You're being unfair.
Unfair?!
Yes. Unfair to me.
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Yeah.
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
He cheats.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
You're a real fucking piece of work.
Oh, I see.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
A flower...
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Yes. I would like to do that.
... I've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... I've known success... and I've felt love... My associates, Chauncey - I've talked with them about you... They're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... I'm very fond of you, Chauncey... And I understand Eve... Tell her that... tell her I'm madly in love with her...
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
Michael!
Punched the President? Oh my god.
What?
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
I don't doubt that.
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
And I'm a Republican.
Relax.
We should slow down.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
He knows our defenses.
Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
--scared the living shit out of us.
It's in there.
We agree.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
This is a very different proposition.
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
Okay.  What's yours?
And you've got one.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
So what's your angle?
Sorry.  Trade secret.
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
We need more dog food --
-- talk in the car, talk in the car, moves your ass, c'mon --
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
Were the flags for Teddy?
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "Crewman #6?"
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
Ask him.
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
I know it was bad.
How could you?  Unless you were there.
Of course.  How much?
Five full nights... days too?
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
How many?
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
How will he eat?
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
No bones?
No bones.
Yeah.
Well, let's go.
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
At least it's over...
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
I thought only me, myself and Lore.
] So <u>that's</u> one of the pearls from                            ] your mysterious journal?  And all this                      ] time I thought you were restructuring                       ] the world's economy.                                        ]
Yeah.
How long have you known her?
About six months.
You like her?
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
No, no. I did.
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
Yeah.
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
Yeah?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
You were talking about the promotion --
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
Yeah.
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
Yeah.
You see?
Yeah, no, I see --
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
....yeah....
So that was your pudding?
....No....
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
No I didn't say that.
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
Double.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
You're giving me the creeps.
Am I dead or not?
There's one way to find out.
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
Why should I be?
For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
You the man!
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
Funny.
Funny...   I better go to bed.
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
We have to find Sophie.
That's Lubosh, the greatest fiddle player in Prague. You must have seen him playing with Johnny on the bridge. ......Come on, let's grab a table.
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
Hi. I brought some wine.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Thanks.
Yeah.
And did you find the leopard?
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
Not in years.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Why?
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
No, he wasn't.  He just lowered himself into a bar stool and said...  'Oo I do feel bad.  I 'ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees!'
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
No, We aren't going to do it.
What?
That's following a train of thought.
Well?
Normal.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Three whole weeks.
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Could be.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
Sorry, old man. Work.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
What.
My... the acrophobia.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
I think I can lick it.
How?
I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
Soon enough.  Here we are.
It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
Hello, is this Elaine?
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Where are you?
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, "Mister President."
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Norman, don't do it!
I'd wish for a puppy.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
I only want one.
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
Show him Central Park.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Watch me pass that Chevvy.
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
For how long?
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
I don't want them here overnight.
Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
What about your toe?
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
Did it hurt?
What do you think, dumbshit?
With what?
The ten dollars.
Oh, ten dollars
Yes.
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
It don't look like a leopard to me.
No...
Let's drop it.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
Benjamin?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Yes.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
I wouldn't know.
Well, I'm not.
You're not.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
I see.
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
Ever had a romance with a crook?
I beg your pardon!
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
I don't want your money!
A real shame.
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
Yes...
Will you come to him on your knees?
Yes...
Be ready.

Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
Have I got things to tell you!
What happened?
I'm engaged.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
I am.
WHAT?
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
You think he's too old for me?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Security.
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
I'll say there is!
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
Jerry - there's another problem.
Like what?
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Like when?
Like right after the ceremony.
Oh.
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
What engagement present?
What's going on?
Can't afford to take chances.
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
No.  Definitely not.
I'm listening.
That will take time.
You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.
-- as we will be.
Lara, please...
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
He'll be weightless.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
He will be odd, different.
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
Here?
More this way.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
WHAT A JOKE...
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
Cheers, Terrance!
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
Least you can do.
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
Its because Im shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
Barbatus?
Put that phone down!
Get me the Radio Tower!
Put it down!
How much?
The zoo?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Don't you remember?
I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
What?
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
Preysing, you're joking with us.
What?  You know him?
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
Went to high school with him. But...
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
Really?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
What'd I do?
In a moment.
He's sleeping.
Only we have to go to work.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Does he have to go?
Pardon me?
What if you couldn't find him?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
Nothin' too showy!
Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
What?
Listen.
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
What did the beer cost?
Fifteen crowns.
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
Still, fifty cents ain't bad.
I was thirsty.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
That's true.  Why is that?
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
Where'd that come from?
Oh, I suppose so.
Could I have a puff?
I don't think your mother would like that.
Just a little one.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
If you want to.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
"Octopus people?"
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
Something happened to him?
I just work for the travel firm.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Half.
What else then?
Lookin' for what's comin'.
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
Then you'll like me.
I do like you.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
What - the curtains?
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
But, Mother ...
Father, lad.
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
Rather what?
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
You're not going to do a song while I'm here!
Have a look at this.
Jen!
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
What?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
You look beautiful to me.
It's undamaged?
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
So you can use it now?
Yes... I suppose so.
Go back to your own time?
I could...
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
One more item--not on the check list.
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
Can we see?
You gonna buy?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
I am now.
Glad I could be of some help.
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Hold up.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
Commander Riker...
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we?
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
What are you talking about, Jack?
I could take after Dad, too.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I meant he's a doctor.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
That'd be something.
I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
Mike wants it.
This is quite a place.
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
He was interested.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
'It's up to Joe'?
That's what he said.
Hold on.
Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
Hmm?
I've been thinking.
Who is this?
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
No.
Where is she?!
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
I told you I don't know.
One.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
Was I?
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Leave me alone!
Remember.
I lied.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
Give me my goddamn life back!
You?  What about me?  Im working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
Please.  Just tell me whats happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
Yes!
Yessir, I can see that.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Uh, yessir.
Ready for hard work, son?
Ready for anything.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Gonna be like money from home.
Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!
The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
<u>What</u>?
Let's go outside and talk.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
Ray.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
Amen to that, brother.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Who's Guilder?
The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin.  Go!
Carter.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
Your father he is.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
I've done you enough favors.
You got it.
It was on the TV.
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
Did you know he was a homosexual?
No, not until after they killed him.
Did you always call him Junior.
Yeah.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
No, that's all.
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
I'm not going anywhere!
Tubbs, these people mean business.
I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
Do you?
Me.
I got eggs down here!
Good d--
What you wanna do?
Come on!
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Yeah, but...
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
Good night...Barbara...
Please.
Yes, sir.
Come with me, John.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
Everybody knows about--
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
Yes, Mother.
And something to sharpen them with?
Yes, Mum.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
No, Mother.
And keep your sword greased.
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
He using her.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
One cannot love and kill.
I love. I kill.
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
Is she a friend of yours?
No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot.
In ages, I know, me neither.
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur.
Nobody.
Hail, Mary.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Oh-huh.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Really.
But -- wait.
Where's Emmett now?
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
No.
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
FUCKIN' "A".
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
What's wrong?
Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
--still go see the OB in the morning--
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
-- just --
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
-- let me do this, okay? --
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The 1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
He and Doris... were having an affair.
They're but off!  Do something!
Destination?
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Checking connection.
She looks a lot like you.
She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
We haven't.
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
The family that steals together, deals together...
Dad'd be proud --
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
What era was that -- ?
The era when crime didn't pay --
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
Price of doing business...
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
Hey.
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
Oh.
John, John.
Don't do that!
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
She's just so... pathetic.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
Find out.
That's right.
I'm supposed to ... trust you?
So?
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
That's what he was saying about you.
We're gonna talk.
Like what?
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
You most certainly do.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Flip a coin.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me
You don't wear garters!
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
Why is everything...like this?
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
It's the truth, Jake.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
We caught 'em.
Good.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
Closer than you think.
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
To see your reaction.
Reaction to what?
What?   This?
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
I'm not listening.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
Nobody's hearing nothing!
Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
Jackie.
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Now you tell us.
Are you a physician?
How is it you come to be here?
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
Ah. An explorer.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
I heard.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Creature? A... human like creature?
You know of it?
Your men are right to be afraid.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Forget it.  We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand?
A little.
So what are you doing out here?
It's colder in there.
You're right.
What's your offer, Jesse?
My offer?  Well I'd say it's a fair one, like I said we're friends.  All I want is my share, which I guess is...
He's in the bathroom.
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
What makes you so sure?
Because...I know.
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
I said he did.
Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
You asked me not to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
Fifteen minutes.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault.
Take it easy, Clark.
Thanks.
No problem.
If you think you're getting past me...
Somebody get off!
Yeah, nine years straight.
My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
It was my master Keitel's idea.
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
Just show the sword.
Have you been logging on?
What?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
I'll do fine.
You don't do that anymore, do you?
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
He's an Italian?
A pig of a Neaponitan. 
I just thought it would be nice.
You're not cured yet, my boy.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us, but be cheerful about it. In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
Who's going to pay me then?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
I'm beginning not to like you.
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
So that's what we're doing.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
That is absolutely not true.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --
Why not?
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
If there was one.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
It's not me.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
They sent us to tell ya.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
DUDES!
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Yes, I --
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Pardon?
Two steps back, please.
How do you like it?
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Does he do this all the time?
But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
Connor, is that you?
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
Really? Thanks.
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
Talk? About me--about us?
Precisely.
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
No--yours, madame.
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
What do you mean?
Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
Yeah, I been there.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Oh yeah? That's good.
C of E, sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Brown hair, is it?
Fair hair, sir.
Blue eyes?
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
No, sir.
Ready, sir.
I don't smoke.
Yes, you do.
I quit.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
What?
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
OK.  OK.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
That's it?
My right.
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
I wasn't going to try anything.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
We're still not where we're going.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
So where have you been staying?
The bus station.
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
What else?
Ma.
Huh?
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
What's to sketch?
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
Broke is more like it.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
Football in college.
You went to university?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
Yes.  You were a Marine.
Is that one hell of a kid?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
He's got a gift for fiction.
We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
Hiding.
I think you're soft or something.
Ben did this.
Ben did this?
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
No.  I'm fine.
It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it?  You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
But it was horrible.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
You felt ill this afternoon because you're getting better. You see, when we're healthy we respond to the presence of the hateful with fear and nausea. You're becoming healthy that's all. By this time tomorrow you'll be healthier still.
So much for my cocktail hour.
Why not? You stink.
That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural.
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
How are things goin' out there?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
Arachtoid.
So I was right.  That's nice to know...
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
They've already been identi- fied.  There's no doubt.
I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
You would do that?
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
Why not?
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
Marion. It's a book.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
It's the truth.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
Animal! Got a little something for you!
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
No. I said Dunbar.
Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
Which one?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
That was about a year ago.
Well, is he?
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
That Richard.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
I paid you back.
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
Solomon, please.  Please.  I am so fucked here if you do this.  This is the worst timing. The worst timing I could ever imagine. I need to keep working.  I have so many debts, so many things, I have, I have, I have -- I have surgery -- I have my oral surgery coming --
Don't be long, Ellen.
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
We were going to do it.
Aye, well, now! 
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Possibly some coffee?
Moffo!
No -- leave it --
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
Of course.
Why?
Because I work with them.
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
Do something!
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
You are, I've seen you.
It wasn't me. It was him.
It was you.
He told me what to do.
But you did it. It was you.
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
How nice. How do you do, Senator?
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
NO?!
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Cool, bro, now listen up...
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got...  twenty-five.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Keep it elevated.
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  
You too, Lieutenant.
Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Count d'Algout...
It is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
He plays it all the time.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Send him in.
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
Keep your eyes peeled.
What about them?
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
Bonkers.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Just drop me off here.
I'll do it.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
No, it was our first date.
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
A Pilates machine?
What do you make with that?
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
What'd you say?
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
I need you to go to Miami.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
How come?
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
And what else is bothering you?
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
I don't like what he does.
It's his work.
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Not enough loving.
Get out of here!
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
You drove him to his torment.
And he drove me to mine.
Then why weep for him?
Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
He is one of the great poets.
Uh huh...
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
C'mon, there's not much difference--
We use the green and yellow.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
All right. What are you gonna do?
I want 15 on the Mets.
How about 7 1/2?
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
You are mistaken.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
What?
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Wait a minute . . .
Huh?
I thought you might paste them into your book.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
I'd like you to have them.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
... Okay.
Open up.    I want to see.
And if I don't?
The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
Yes, sir.
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
Right behind you, T.J.
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
There would be a moon tonight.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that, give it --
We must examine you.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Please ... we are doctors.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
[Beat] We will.
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
What?
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
I don't want to go to jail for this.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Sh, sh sh sh sh.
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
You're right, Joe.
Of course I am.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
No we're not.
We're not?
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
But suppose he loses?
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
But suppose it doesn't?
Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You be careful.
I'm signing off.
Eric!
Alright, asshole.
He's alive.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
Oh.
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
Who are you?
No. No one never did.
There's two new ones over at your place, ain't there Ruby?
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
No --
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
Why?
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
And, sometimes you control it...
It went away....
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
You're living.
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
Bret. What the hell is going on?
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
GET OUT!!
Who was this partner of his?
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.
I do, baby, I do.
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
Oh?
She's gotten into your equations.
Are you firing me, Jim?
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
You are...
Uh-huh..
Might be exciting for you.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
Short range scan.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
Yuri... are you...
Sera... please go.
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Is it drug related?
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
Picks up again just on the other side.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Oh, is that what caused it?
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
How much money have you got?
Heaven knows. A lot.
Well, that being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!
Here with you.
Where?
The tall trees...
Have you been here before?
Yes...
When?
Can't move.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
Please go back, bring the children to us.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
What is this?
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
I guess we've been staying up too late.
I know it.
I don't know.
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
What if he's busy tonight?
<u>Lure</u> him. 
What are you saying...
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
...on the way in.
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
It's the White House.
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
Do you?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
Says who?
Says me. Do you dream often?
Do you?
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
It's all right. It's organic.
Oh, Harold. 
For you.
He likes you.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
Barely, yes.
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Sorry? 
Thanks. That makes us square.
...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>Every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> Old Shoe, our...
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
Really?  That's sudden.
My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I want an hour with him.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
He has a cute what...?
I'll explain.
Some kind of archive --
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
Yes.
I couldn't have another bite.
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
Get the box, nephew.
I see.
I'm staying with a friend.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
It's not like that, luv.
It never is.
Where?
Times Square.
Hi, Allison --
Have you got a minute?
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
But it's your birthday.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
They still have to take it to a jury.
... Lover's Lane?
Are you Jody?
Couple of weeks... Listen --
I love this car. Some cars sit, you know? This car, a car like this... grows. I mean you never know, with a car like this, where this car has been.
I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Why you say that?
'Cause your lips is getting black.
I don't want to place you in any position --
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
Your aunt?
Mrs. Smith.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Right.
Well, which one?
Margaret.
Funny old bird.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Just relax....
Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
Clockworks.
Clockworks?
You could do worse.
That's fair enough.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
Went ballistic?
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
So what's it going to be?
Well, I've paid for the ticket.
She plays the clarinet, too.
All he can. All he can.
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
A man scared me.
A man?  Was it a dream?
Uh huh.
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
Normally not. Unless it's an Arterio-Venous Fistula --
I need a typewritter.
We got em.  North...No, Henry James was the novelist, Frank James was a criminal...  Yep, you came to the right place.  Jessie James was the <u>Brother</u>.  Of the novelist, that's right.  That's alright Susie.  See you tomorrow, Susie.
I still think you should go down.
Anderton --
You were right.  I'm not being set up.
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
That's up to Pilgrim.
Speak of the devil!...
Mark!
What?  You gotta be joking.
We go back, seal it up again, and come in tomorrow night - every night 'till we get out of here. There's gotta be a way. Those bats got out someplace.  Now let's go.  Doubletime!
Fuck off.
I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
Just the legit shit.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
Oh, OK.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself something.  Besides, I got something important to do...
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
So were you.
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
But Scottie, you don't have to!
I want to! Come on!
Try to communicate with her somehow.
You think that'll help?
Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
Yes, mam...
Ask your daddy to give you some word about when he'll be comin' home -- and tell 'im we love him.
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
Everybody has a choice.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Of course.
Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it.
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Definitely off.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
I know.
Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people.
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
The man you had the fight with.
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
Keep it.
It's a twenty.
Keep it.
Fucking hope not.
Get knotted!
What was that?  What the Christ was that?
I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
But listen, Tom, I
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Better than I've ever been in my life.
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy.
Ah!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Certainly!
They're all right, aren't they?
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Darling, remember you're Gaston Monescu. You're a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship you as a crook. Steal, swindle, rob--but don't become one of those useless, good-for-nothing gigolos!
So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
Who are you really?
That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
Of course not.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Yes, it is.
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Occupied France?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
What are they?
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
And the other alternative?
My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.
I like you, DIl
Love me.
Yes.
Tell me you love me.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Then say it.
Love you, Dil.
You do?
Yeah.
What would you do for me?
Anything.
There are ads? For parents?
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
What?
Just do it!  Meet me there, now.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
But you're the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin' silent when you know the score I'm guilty you hear me? I'm guilty... .
I don't want to hear it in there.
I don't get it!
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
But you've got to listen to me.
I'll find you a priest.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Strong...
Her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is what's underneath.  The part she was protecting.  There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now.
Uh-huh.
He tapped that.
Naw!
Go ask him.
Cap'n...?
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
Show me the way?
Yes.
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Oh, yah?
No hard feelings?
Are you kidding?
I always said you were a gentleman.
I'll bet.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Bring her forward.
Anytime.
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Then you listen to me, for I am expert. That girl, she give me a headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, I think, maybe, she make a very good typist.
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
Why not?
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
What good will that do?
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Closer to eight.
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
What?
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
Show some compassion.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Uh-huh.
Bump?
When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
-- and we are sure...
What?
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
Okay.
Worth a try.

Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
...did you?
You're fucked, man.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...-tion?
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
...stole the truck.
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
...piece of shit was worth.
It won't even start half the time.
You know what I'm sayin'?
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
...or nephew or some good old boy...
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
...overdrawn bank accounts.
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
So you took his...
...truck.
So I took his truck, yeah.
 Yeah.
You know.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
Don't act so -- crazy.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
That's a good girl.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
How do you do, Charles?
Give me a drink, will ya?
You don't need a drink.
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
Home!
Home?
I'm fired.
Who fired you?
You did.
Hold relative position here...
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Whatta we do now?
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
Come on, Fran.
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
I'm heading out of town.
Okay.
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
How many shots you say you heard?
Four to six.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
I told you.  I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.
I think I'll...carry him.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
I'm not much of a critic.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
Sure.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
Sounds good.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
Oh.
That was my idea.
You never did like me much, did you Verne?  And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you?
Shut up.
Fix raft first.
Water water water --
Stay put!  I know my way around.
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
That's the original part.
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
Native costume?
Y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
Well, they go to guard school.
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
You know why.  You already said.
What'd I say again?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
What?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
I said all that?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
Whatever.
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
No, I don't.
Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
... The way she moves.
I'll go for that.
I gave it to him yesterday.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
No, I left it in his office.
Did you see him?
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
Who's to say he ever will?  He's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes -- In fact, I'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
Fire!!!
She's as good as gone...
You can't think like that!  We're watching them like a hawk--he's bound to trip up, make one false move--
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...
What is it? Where's Casey?
Casey? Casey?
A little bit.
Guess what.
What?
Your grandfather's here.
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
You are sick, that's why he's here.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Maybe he won't.
Please, call me Mordechai.
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
Agatha, you're never going back there.
I am going back.  I see myself there.
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
Charming.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
Give it to me.
When you bring in Doucet.
Holy cow!
I'm having a stroke.
You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
How's the trip?
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
And?
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Huh.
I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
I guess.
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared...  ...and run.
Someone get a doctor.
There's one coming.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
I'll get some towels. 
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Entering the upper ionospere...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
Ignore it. We'll be fine.  Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark...
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
You're mad at me, aren't you?
What?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's --  Who said anything about girlfriend?
Are you insane?!
I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --
Fuck you.
Cursin'.  That's a penalty kick for unsportsmanlike conduct, mate.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
No, thanks.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
That's right.
Who's Keyser Soze?
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
And Larry?...
What about Larry?
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
Shut up!
Free, if you're the president.
Thank you.
Would you like the same suite?
Definitely.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
What's the question mark?
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
How do you do that?
Good question.  See, that's where the fun comes in.  ARCADE changes it every time. He's a machine without a soul. Once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
I think you heard me, Bill.
You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
You mean I won't resist them.
Detroit.
Isn't he?
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Are they?  Why would they?
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
I would make you rich.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
Beg -- beg of you! You crawling graveyard rat!
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Just for him?
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Up where?
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Oh fuck! 
I should like people to read what I've written.
I'll handle that later.
My readings indicate great instability.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
Burn!
I think we should go.
No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.
Not for me, it ain't.
Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. This ain't no life for a man. Any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. I sure know I would.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
Neither do I.
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
No idea.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Honestly, my life.
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
Yeah?
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
No thank you.
Oh.  Oh yes.
Well can I come in or not?
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
SAILOR!!!!
Yes, I am.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Thanks, Franky.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
Okay.
Keith do not trivialize this.
I'm not. What's the problem?
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
What kind of seats can we have?
Not padded ones.
So what do we do?
You go down there.
Go down where?
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Honey I don't have the time...
I need your help.
We're leaving in three hours.
I need your help.
I'll call them from the road.
Do you love me?
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Take care of those chairs.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Maybe.
Lots more where he came from.
A drink...
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Thanks.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
May the Force be with you.
I dabble.  May I?
Hidden camera.
Wings?
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash....
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out we take our cut.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
It'll do.
So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this a deal I sweated and bled for on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
I am no going to show you the <u>secret</u> <u>handshake</u>! 
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
And then where are we?
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
No you're not.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Yes, I know.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
I don't know what you're talking about.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
Will you excuse me?
What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
Out of the question.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
Not a thing.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
Thank you for volunteering.
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
What do you think this is kid?  Lick Barney the Dinosaur's pussy fucking kiddie hour?  Huh?  This is real life with consequences you take to the grave!
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
I'm not hungry.
Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
Yes, Addison.
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Yes, Addison.
Take your nap, now. And good luck for tonight.
Don't hurt him...
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
Please, Gabriel, don't...
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
He has already agreed to come.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
That's no way to talk...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
If you want me to -
I'm here.
OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock.
Tomorrow -
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Got a warrant?
You fit a lot of descriptions.
I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time...I took mine to the Confederate States of America...  So did you, Reverend...
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.

Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Oh.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
With great pleasure.
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Is that your version of a pep talk?
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
Fine!
It's still early. What's your next class?
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
What's wrong?  Tell me.
We can't talk about it on the phone.
Your wife.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Maybe soon--
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
I think he's jealous of Havel.
GO-GO-GO!!
...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
Shhhh. Shhhh.
Please.
H'm?
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
It was only a mouthful!
Do you think we should take her up to bed?
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
I hope you're right...
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
No way.
Yes, Patrick?
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
Caesar, what are we going to do?
They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
They're right behind the door.
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
No?
No. Your eyeball goes. The top of your head. Gotta wind up with athlete's stomach.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Don't worry about it.
There are cops all over the place.
So what?  Where are they gonna go?
I'm sure he's busy.
Don't you even want to ask?
Yes, desperately.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Better than I...
That's the spirit!
No, I didn't have to.
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
They must've just missed me.
They said you had to run out.
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull.
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
How potent?
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
We?  You've taken it?
We all did.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
Yeah.
I don't think so.
Did you know Sebastian well?
You might say that.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
That's right.
I'm sure you're going to love it there.
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
Huh?
What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
Car accident.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Just be careful, okay?
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
Guess so.
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
But it's a small room, Jason.
It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it  to know me better.
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
James is... I don't know...
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
I'm not sure that's possible.
Sure it is.
Better tell the boss.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
This is a travesty.  A debacle.
What?  I improved her a little...
It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here.  A mystery or a damn miracle.  And by god I can't tell which.  Boy, you say you have no idea who you are?  That right?
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
Why not.
Are you serious.
Have you ever known me not to be.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Population?
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
And if I cut my hair again?
It will grow back again!
But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.
Yes.
Were you recently promoted?
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Thank you.
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart, like myself-- for instance, if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why, I'd say you were a man to watch. For a fellow your age, you'd be in a spot to make a great start in life. If you liked business--you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top. Or politics. If you like being a Senator. No reason why you couldn't come back to that Senate for the rest of your life.
--and we brought it back with us!
Really?
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
Somehow I feel safer in here.
I'm going to see you get that chance.
Fuck you!
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
You better start.
Yes, my lord.
Let's see.
Oh, yeah?
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
Too bad...
I'll be back.
At one. Promise?
Sure.
Her heart.
Can you give her something?
She'll go into coma.
Oh yes you are!
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
That's right.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
Seems like nothing but, lately.
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
Not at all.
Where's our friend?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
I hope so. I need it immediately.
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Yeah, or get me drowned.
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
You still carrying passengers?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it.  Get you towed.  Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Coming with you.
You will not live to see the morning.
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
I don't know about that?
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
I'm not sailing his boat.
But I thought --
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
Anywhere?
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
You already have.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
I think you'll do very well.
Hey, thanks, man.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
A teleprompter.
What?
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
That's it?
Not much else.
What's your business?
I'm a professional killer.
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
Oh, thank you.
Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
Says who?
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Full clip to the body --
From up close or far away?
His chest was hamburger --
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
And you and Private Graves--
We were just dancing--
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
The United States.
I know. But which state?
Yes, you did.
You made those tapes...
They were performance pieces.
You set your patients on fire!
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
No prob...
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
Wow, that's uh...great...
Somebody's getting comfortable.
What?
He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12.
I'll go.
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
You're sure nobody's following us?
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
What?
What?
Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
Yah.
We're good to loan in.
Yah.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Well it worked.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
It's all we've got.
I predict we're lost.
Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Make time?  Is everybody in this town on drugs?
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
No, no, no, no!
Take him out! Take this motherfucker out!
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
Where?
Dupont Circle.
Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
Give me a mirror...
Sneaking around with your brother?
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
Why do you play at being drunk?
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
No. What happened?
Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
Thank you, sir.
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
I'm fine, sir.
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
And you believe the NLF?
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
Jim West.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Funny.  So am I.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
How did you guess?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Why --
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Now, what makes you think that?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Great story Goober, how much?
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
Not with me.  Not with people.
No cowboy shit. Right.
I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
You can't go now.
I have to.
You want to.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
I'll tell her.
Yeah...how'd you know?
Call it a guess...
Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
Mr. Mitchell.
A little something on account perhaps?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
It's okay.
Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
Will you wait a minute?
You don't want me to go.
No idea.
Well, press something!
Wait!
That's not food.  Can't be food.
Looks like food.
Where's Kelly?
She's with Sarah!
Very deep... usually...
He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
Drink your milk.
How shall I do it?
And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Then you've read it?
Not yet.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
There a part in it for you?
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
Sounds fair.
What do you get out of it?
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
Well, he's a good soldier.
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
Pull the cash.
No.
...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
Nothing.
I heard something. A squeal.
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm going on over there...
I'm not some piece a crap.
I know you're not.
You treat me like I was.
I'm sorry.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
Now, hand...
Well, we won't do any of that shit!
What?
Once you been up there, you know you been some place!
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
The King pipeline.
Elektra would control it all.
Probably an asteroid field ....
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
Sure, I guess.
Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff.
I'll think of something, don't worry.
You catch Dylan?
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
You have a raccoon?
Tsch, a few.
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
I can think of another word.
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Are you?
Yeah.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Fuckin' A.
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Call me back in ten.
Had a package to deliver.
You?  Personally?
I had it on the island with me.
Must be a story there.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
It's all we've got.
Jesus
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
Please don't ask me to do this.
It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
You son of a bitch...
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
You were unhappy?
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
The reason?
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
I see.
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
Sit down.
What?
No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
I want to pick up my car.
What are you talking about?
A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
I'll hitch.
Oh, no, you won't.
Right.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
What are you doing here?
I'm going to tell the truth.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
No no. I knew.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
But you're Irish!
There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it.
Oh, definitely.
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
To Paris. Paris, France.
Thats the one...
So youre not at a non- profit firm?
Not with what they pay me...
Youre not married, are you?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
He says -
Hmm!
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Uh, losers!  All losers!
You're too demanding.
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
Braces.
Braces?
Yes.
You don't need braces.
Yes I do.
Your teeth are fine.
I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
Come here. See if we can move it.
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Will you come here?
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
Yes.
Who?
Something... I've got...you don't.
You rich kids... are all the same !
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
What is it?
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
You're out of time, man.
Hey, this is great.
Hudson, give us a break.
Shh! Just a second.
Take it easy.
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
What's her name?
Betty.
What's she like?
Okay.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Sorry.
Yo, dobree!
Totally! Look!
Unnhh.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
Urgh.
Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In Manhattan?
Of course. Where else?
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
That's where the what comes in.
The what?
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
You can't be more specific than that?
You're not going to bet it all....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
No!
How long had that been going on?
A couple of weeks, I think.
I'm doing the best I can!
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
I love you.
I'm listening.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
Mookie's OK.
You listening to me?
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
How do you know this?
I know.
You really think so?
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
So what do you want me to do?
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
He'll never know.
Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
What happened next?
...yes. Get her on the phone...
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
Gruber...
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital.'
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
There'll be time for that.
Yes, sir!
Louder!
Yes, sir!!
I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
Don't even...I'm there.
I wasn't sure.
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Let's go the zoo.
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
Follow me.
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
Hang on, Voltaire.
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Your friends use the pool too.
I take out the garbage.
Don't strain yourself.
The Scots will fight for us?
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
What else could've done that?
Yeah. I can imagine.
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
A game?
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
What are you talking about?
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
I'm sorry, about this...
You should be.
... dollars?
Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
What are you saying?
This means they've given up trying to break the picket line.  Now we can all fight together -- all of us.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
What do you mean?
Her hands.  Like that.
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
No, just give you a splitting headache.
Well it's not working.
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
Then let's have it.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Aye-aye, captain.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer?  Well, all right.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Ale. I don't mind.
Right, Miss.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Yeah.
How much did he pay you?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
It was a lot of fucking money.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
Thanks for reminding me.
I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
Then you found the leopard --
I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
When we're making love?
Yes.
Sometimes. Afterward.
Does he go down on you?
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Yeah. But not any more.
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
But the experiment was a failure.
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
Andy...
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You think I scam?
You're unlucky.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
An hour?
Mmm.
Okay.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Call me.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Okay, pete. 
Oh great.
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
Just use the keyboard...
The keyboard... How quaint.
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
I'll be there.  The Danburrys.  Friday night.  Thank you, Chris.
Sure.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
That's cool.
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
Signs?
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
Mister McMurphy!
But it's light in there now.
Please.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Louis, are you sure?
I'm sure.
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
Not till next year.
At one in the morning?
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
You let him pierce his nose?
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
No, baby!
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
You're not saying it's up to me?
Can you walk?
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
I don't know -
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
Morning.
I wonder if you could help me.
Try my best.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Yep.
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
You weren't waiting for me.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
Be still ...
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
We'll work it out.
It's possible
Hang in there.
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
Because she's sick.
The ships are gaining...
Maybe we should knock first?
Home.
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
That's right.
Where?
Hospital.
Which hospital?
Back home.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
No.  Or why you should.
Deco.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
That...? Vestibule.
How about -- ?
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
It's about goddamn time.
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
Sheriff?
Then that's all you had to say.
But
You always been this selfish?
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
Two words.  Disco Express.
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
'Booty Time.'
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
Like me.
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
Oh yeah?
That's right.
I'll call you.
Fine.
See you later.
Anyway, you're crazy.
That way.
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matterare you falling? Come here.
You're officer of the watch, George.
I'm sorry, Skip.  It's this damned book.  Lawford gave it to me.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Something like that.
The Rodger Young just burned up...
Alan-One...
Yeah, I can smell it.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
She's scared! Fear is an emotion!  Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Ms life is part of the bet.
Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
Can you hang on a second?
Tell me.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Shoot.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
As for example, what?
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Vampires of the world, beware.
Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.
I wouldn't like.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.  Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian.
Michael!
What?
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
Fourteen? --
Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
There was a group of Girlscouts here from Indiana last month.  One of them expressed an interest in a Frederick Remington bust.  The president took her into the oval Office, for a period...
All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
Master safety on.
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
Leave her alone!
You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
You will keep in touch.
Of course. Every day.
O.K.
Take care, Dad.
Call me tomorrow.
I will. See you.
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Right now, I only wish to join them.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
She can't remember.
What happened to the baby?
Yes.
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
Go to sleep Ellen.
No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
Same time. What about you?
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
I'll call you. Let you know.
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
Helluva day.
To say the least.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Get the fuck outta here already.
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
We know that...
Can I have an evil twin?
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
I don't know, George...
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
I'll think about it.
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
I said I'll think about it.
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
Hmm?
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
...yeah.
Well, I ...
My feelings exactly.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
How would you describe him?
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
Oh yeah.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
You can't be too careful.
Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
Go away.
Hurry up!
No.
You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.
I felt you...looking through me...
We walked all night...
You told me that I was...
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
Not really, no.
Just below ten thousand.
But you continued to fight.
You can count on me, sir!
Ready when you are...
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Where did you learn to do this?
What?
But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
Tonight?
Alone.
What for?
Some service deserves service in return. No?
What do you mean?
Isn't it obvious?
I didn't know you taught.
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Courtyard?
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition, John.  Discipline.  Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
We'll save them for seed. A toast!
We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
I said with the mouth shut.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
To put us back together again when we fall.
It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
Sure.
Do I make you horny?
What?
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
That's right.
I'd like to thank the academy...
Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call.  In the meantime, don't leave town.  I may need to bring you in for questioning.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
... I see.
Do you know him well?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
Making our very own solstice fire.
Coffee's warming me up.
Yes?
If you got something to say, say it.
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
You don't know the procedure.
I know him.
And a car.
Mmmmm...
Climb, Gabe, climb!
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
That is so right.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
Now, that's really stupid.
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
Youre wrong about one thing.  Im not the only one whos seen you alive.
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
I'm gonna hate it.
Buy ya a beer?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
It can't be.
Who is she Daddy?
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
What did you hear?
It's fine.
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
We're not skipping this treatment.
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
Fuck you.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
That shit's saving your life, you asshole!
It's been Hell.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
Huh?
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
No.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
As though you do what I say.
That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?
No... do you?
Why should I?
I don't know.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
How's the beautiful lady?
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
Well -- last night was not so good.
I thought she was splendid!
Yes -- but the audience.
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
Scotty, can we make it inside?
Hi.
I took too long.
After we've looked, we'll talk.
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
But things change.  You gotta think ahead.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
There ya go.
Good, let's drink up.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
They're fine.
Yahoo !!!!!
It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
Fuck it.  Alright.
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
Yeah.
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
It wasn't a joke.
Tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids. Kids!  I love them.
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
This time...
We'll work something out, Joe.
Any time.
Pleased to meet you.
Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
Long day. Go to sleep.
Am I too heavy for you?
No.
-- You found his mugshot?
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew.
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
You called him?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Is she on the phone?
Yes...You-youre not going to take Shiva away?
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
That might work.
Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.  And we're going to need a containment crew.
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
And people better clear out of here! Now!
Well, yeah.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
Thank you.
I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
Not bad, not bad.
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
Yeah.
Nothin'.
What are you doin' here?
I, umm, came to see you.
You know somebody around here?
No.  What you do today?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
We dont have to, Jim.  Hell come after us.
Whats going to make him do that?
What he didnt get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Ill have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
Pirate.
Hi.
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
Is the ship going to sink??
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
I'm not afraid. Are you?
Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
I wonder if that was the same copter.
Good morning.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Yes.
Is there a part for me?
No.
How do you know?
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
Why not?
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Where?
In a harem.
What's that?
A brothel.
Oh!
A Turkish brothel.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
Did you tell 'im I was too busy for that kinda stuff?
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
Judy, that's stupid.
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
You know that's impossible!
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
Brimmer.
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
Yeah.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
No, that's not, I couldn't...
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
Of course.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Try next of kin.
Next of kin!
Okay, everyone.
Hey.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Pass.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned.
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
I told you. I like you.
See, I never knew that.
Well now you do.
...Hell.
What do you think?
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
Do I?
Like you're concerned.
Who?
Catherine Tramell.
She said what you said she'd say.
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
Yeah. It's pretty good.
It's like we've finally arrived.
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
I'm not scared of you, Max.
Two.
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
Not every day?
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah?
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
Radiation interference?
There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
Shuddup.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
I didn't mean police.
I've got to go ...
It's alright.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
Then I'm here till I die?
Till they kill you. Yeah.
Then why bother curing me?
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
So it's to be torture.
I thought we were goin' into town.
I hate goin' into town.  That's about as close to town as I like to get.
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
What?
One of them fingered the old man.
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
Oh... Yeah.
Mind if I sit down?
No.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
Will you come soon?
Soon as I finish.
...within five minutes.
It's for you.
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
I'll go and make up his room!
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Mr. Brown?
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
What about the gold?
What about it?
Maybe we should split it up now.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
The hell we are.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Vegas? What'd you think?
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
Impressions? Those are hard.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
A scary dream?
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
I like that.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Well, of course, right...
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
That's right!
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
No.
Jesus Christ...
I'm like a joke to them.
Then show me who you are.
Yeah.
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
No problem. What's on your mind?
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
Whatever.
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
Sure.
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
I agree with what you said...truly.
What did I say?
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
How's that?
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Why?
What would I do with it? Run amok?
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
I can hardly wait, Coco.
Agreed.
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
Dwayne listen to me -
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
I don't know what you're -
Don't lie to me!!!!
Truman, you're gonna be late!
He'll be here.
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
I can't do that.
I want to be put on this case.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Who's running it?
Roper...
Who's running it!
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
What's that supposed to mean?...
Nothing.
Yeah.  Drowning.
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
Okay, okay.
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
Where does he live?
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
Give me the address.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
...what are we going to do...?
Why's that?
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
I don't like that one.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
But we accomplish the mission.
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
No, sir.
That's a mystery to me.
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
No.  I missed that.
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
We're great.
I mean, you're really back.
For good.
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
Try that one.
Hi, Bob.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
That'd be great.
No.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
What was she running from?
I don't know.
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
Yes.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
Why do you think he did it?
It got to be too much for him.
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
I didn't mean to...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
I had to ask.  I apologize.
No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
I think we just need to get wasted.
I'll give it everything.
You know I don't do "contracts." But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
No.
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
Oh my God --
It's in my room!
Yes.
There's no child here.
But ... the dogs...
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
Well, excuse me for livin'!
Sometimes I really hate you.
Yeah?  Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  But take my advice.  Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
We're going to work on the message.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
The most logical choice.
You don't have a shred of evidence!
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
Just what I want to do.
You'll lose the signal!
What little old man?
That little old man.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
If I could get my hands on you...
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
Leave her alone, I tell you!
I do not joke in my proposal.
I didn't know, there were two islands.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
I... no, I... I just can't...
It's okay, son.  We just need to call you something.  That's all.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
I'm awfully sorry.
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
I told ya.
Wow!
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
You got it! See you later honey.
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet.
Right here. Now sit down.
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
What if I've figured a way?
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
A delivery device for nicotine.
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
You're gonna get your fix...
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
Most certainly.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Poor communication skills.
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it.
Yep.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Yeah.
Nasty way to go.
Yes.
We put him to bed for the night.
What happened?
You okay?
I'm fine.  What's up?
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
How will I know?
I'm sorry?
How will I know what she requires?
You'll be sent a message.
Who'll bring it to me?
Her Highness' Equerry.
I need a man who knows where I am.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
That's not good enough.
Oooh! Navy Seals!
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
Mm-hmmmmm.
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
I miss you.
Let us wish him peace.
Nice of you to come.
No. Frank was a good bloke.
Someone down here?
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
I'm not telling you.
Why not?
You'd think I was mad.
Berry-picking.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
And what's that?
With our hands.
Good to see you.
Is there someplace we can talk?
"But we'll be the same as we started...
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Mm-hm.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
A pleasure to torment me?
No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
You switched the charts; you tell me.
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
Really?
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
She seemed upset.
What's wrong with your back?
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
Let's check am out.
That son of a bitch.
That'd be my reaction too --
He's lying.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
I'm serious --
What are there character traits?
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Exactly!
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Yep, you guessed it.
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
What expenses?
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
You gotta go back out there.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
Uh. Do you like England?
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
I like you.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
Sorry?
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
Sugar?
Get me Room 414.
What do you think you're doing?
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
Ask away, Major.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
I don't think so, sir.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
I see.
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
I'm trying to, sir.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
That's close enough, Major.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Where do you go from here?
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
I didn't mean that, in life.
In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
My wife.
You'd better be kidding.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Get going.
What?
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
I want to be alone.
That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it. 
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
You've got her? Where?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
Of course I do. Where are you?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
What are you talking about?
Just bring your checkbook.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
What did he say to you in French?
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
Terrific.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
I'll secure the perimeter.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
He didn't either.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
All right.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
Good.
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
French?
Yes sir.
French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
What's that?
You're still jealous.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
You know I'm a good person.
Mmm hmm.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Oh.  Well, what's this?
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
You don't think I love you?
-- And the cooling unit on the other.
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
Never really thought about it.
A story?
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
Who's side are you on?
I beg your pardon?
What if I plead guilty?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
If I don't cooperate?
With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
If I were?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
I am.
Your own work?
And I did it myself right on there.
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
I don't want to talk about him.
Fine.
It's none of your business.
Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
I know.
I think this is about where we came in.
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Please!
Your mother's not dead.
Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
No, he's gone.
No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
I can't, I have to go home.
Mitch...
Wait here. Don't move.
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
What are you shooting for?
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom.'
Don't you get along with your parents?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
Don't move!
Howdy to you.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
But how could you say such a thing?
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
And have you any other truths to tell me?
You already know what they are.
You mean Sandro, don't you?  Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.
She's in the other room.
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Because it's your job, that's all.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
What?
It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.
Will you shut up!
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
The real war is in us.  History is a symptom of our disease.
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
About what?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
So?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
What do you want?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Leave me alone.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Are they?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
I do not seek forgiveness.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
How well are you trained in music?
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Where?
Here in Vienna.
Then you must know this.
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
You tore it again!
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Why?
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
What do you want?
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
What do you get out of it?
Peace of mind.
That's it?
Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
Oh.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
I mean for Ted.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
I'll think of something.
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
Yes I do.
You don't...
In the corporate offices.
Oh... really?
Yeah...
What do you do?
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
You do not.
It's what I do.
You're so funny...
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
--Stop it--
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
--No.
Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
Yes, thank you very much.
John said you're Amish.
Yes.
Oh.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Something in your car...
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
What?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
Well, what is it?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
What's that stand for?
Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
I know.
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
So... how did they get here?
Thank you.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Yeah? What's his name?
Victor Laszlo.
Victor Laszlo?
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
No!
Yes!
Keep them alive.
Does wood sink in water?
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Thanks are hardly necessary.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
It ain't for lack of trying.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
Who?  Not another goddamn Cuban?
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
No, I wouldn't.
Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
'Fraid not.
I always am.
Don't get hurt.
I never do.
Don't hurt no one.
Well. If you say so.
Perm?
Uh-uh.
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
I don't fuckin' cook.
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
I can handle that.
Well, get to it.
That's not correct.
What's wrong with it?
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.
Who knows?
I just want to be a superhero.
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...
No! I resigned last week!
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
What do you mean?
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
I don't think of us that way - ever.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
He says --
I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
...what...?
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
Of what?
Of telling you.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
I had a baby.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
I almost got married once.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
Lovely.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
What are you doing on the wall?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
What for?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Do you think this cross will protect you?
No, I...
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Killing her won't solve anything.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.
Oh, right.
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
Yes.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
For example?
Shut up, you!
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Sorry, love.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
Well Cooper...
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
I guess not Cooper...
No, sir...
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Gorch?
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
What are you talking about?
Like hell they wouldn't.
Drum banging real times.
What's the rush?
I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women...
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Not that.
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
Last one down springs for room service.
No.
I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Daddy's dead.
We said 48 hours.
That's a long time to be in jail.
Switch hands.
What?
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
You were?
Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
I don't know.
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
No.
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
They just don't want us going in there.
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.

Stop crowdin the plate!
He told you that?
Yes sir.
Are you sure?
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
Allah will provide.
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
What do you mean?
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
How do you remember how to talk?
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
I was countin' on it.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
I am committed. I love you.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
I copy.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
Rooster!  Forget the hen stuff. Be safe, honey.  Over.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
I can't.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
Aaauuuhhh!!!
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
What?
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
You're right.  Talking too much again.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
Just do your job.
Bullshit!
Bullshit yourself!
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
You just said...
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Nothing...
What have we done to hurt you?  And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do?  Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh?  You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
I'm going home to my machine.
That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
Hard luck -- like me.
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
That's what some folks say.
There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow.  You hear 'bout that, Uncle T?
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
You, too. Kick ass today.
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
Raus! Raus! All of you!
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
NO!
You fucking liar!
Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite "intense". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "The great cure for lycanthropy!" Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha.
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
Kent!
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
I'll see that bet.
Could be, I guess.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
Fine.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
With what?
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.
Are you alright?
Fuck.  I think I'm gonna throw up, I think.  I haven't thrown up since I was twenty years old.
I never have before.
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
Where am I?
Lennox Hospital.
I'm awake?
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
That's a lie. My family was here.
I'm sorry.
Last night! They were as real as you are!







No.
Where's Elvis?!
Dead, last time I...
 ...checked. 


Yeah. I guess we did.
Yeah...
I'll get him for you, Nick.
Positive.
You sure?
Positive.
My friend told me she lived around here.
Your friend must be misinformed.
Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
Goddamn it, Ma-...
...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
...it.
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
...-time,  remember?
Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
I can handle it.
Mm.  It doesn't take a genius.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Tempus fugit!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul!
Gerade aus dann links!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.
I want a job, Giles.
All right. As what?
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
Are you going to meet with him?
Most certainly.  Arrange it.
It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!
It's no biggie.
It's all right. I really do know them.
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
What??
Where did you get this?
Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
What?
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
What are you doing here?
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Do you think they ever existed?
Yes I do.
Do you want to become one?
Become?  One is born a saint.
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Then we'll stay up together.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
No.
Then why?
There's no reason.
Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
What's going on?
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
This ought to be good.
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
Oh, yes.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
No. I like this attic very much.
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
Hey buddy!
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
What's up?
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
I'm on my way.
Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
Well, I suppose...
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
Mister LaPlante...
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Mister LaPlante...
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Mister LaPlante...
Look, I got this kid.  We got a goddamn relationship!  I'm takin' him to a movie tonight!  He worships me.  If I go down what's this do to my son?  I'm his goddamn role model for Christ sake!
Please, have a seat.
Are you talking to me!
Yeah. Come onwe're stopping here for the night.
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
By the hour of nine.
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up.
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
Note. Put it in the note.
Why did yo do this for me?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
-- go ahead.
-- well aren't you --
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
Who?
To Caitlin!!
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one.  I don't even know what a gentleman is.  You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs. Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything I had.  Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper.  Or his mother.  It's pretty clear - I'm not a gentleman.
I thought I was in good shape.
Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
All night?
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
I was in a bowling-alley.
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights.
What is that?
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
Before.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
I will treasure this.
Sally!!!!
What do you mean?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
No way... Would you?
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
No. I never feel like that.
I do.
Is it about my teeth?
Yes.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
Owns the hardware store.
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
Play along?
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
To who?
And no one'll know about this?
It'll be our secret.
Showbiz.
Sorry.
Please don't do it again.
I said I was sorry.
I can't move my patients around to accommodate one person.
Yeah.
All night?
Yeah.
We're gonna be here a week?
Yeah.
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
Yeah.  You mind?
Why would I mind?
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
You love sharks?
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
Apparently.
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
You're welcome.
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
What happened to your eye?
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Don't worry. He's out of town.
How far out of town?
Trust me. We're safe.
Yes, I am.
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
As a march hare.
Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
Don't want weak legs.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
-- The legs.
Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know.
Keep trying.
You want to try?
Sure.
You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.
Very, very?
Yes -- very, very big!
He couldn't get through the door, then?
Ready quantum torpedo.
Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
Is that so?
My father.  William Turner?
Dozens. It's very sad.
Okay, I'm thinking.
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
One.
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
Okay.
Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...
Not yet.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
Who's the subject?
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
He's a suitor!
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
Check, ten thousand air burst.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
That's right.
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
And that is?
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Even in Berlin.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
Hello....  Where?  In Allentown.  Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that.  Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him.  I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it?  That looks like an admission of guilt.  And I had such hopes.  I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that....  Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
Exactly.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
Claiming their place in the world.
I know.
But all these people...
Now.
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
Did you go riding?
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Let's.
Yes.
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
Alexander.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
No, we created the Morlocks.
Created?
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
As slaves.
To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
You mean you blew it.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off.  Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
Really?
Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Nope.
What do you think's going on?
Could be anything.
Been checking your messages?
Obsessively.
Huh.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
Absolutely!
Now, Swana...
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard."
Dr. John Whittlesley.
What's that doing here?
I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
It's a thought.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
See if they'll what?
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Oh -- oh!
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
Shucks, and I got all dressed up.
Good-bye!
I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
SECOND COUSIN, THREE TIMES REMOVED.  NOW  GET OFF ME!
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Shall we tell her?
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
I'm fine, Francis.
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
They still around, your folks?
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
How do you know?
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
How did your mama die?
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
She says it's for the times when he's good to her. She's lonely since daddy died. She said sometimes she don't know why.  He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too good. He sure is nice though. He's from St. Louis. People who are queer can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. For bein' the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle.
You're leaving?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Is that a boat?
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Yep.
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Death is a very light thing for you.
Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.
All my life I've known.
Starling...?
One moment, and they're at the <u>Seven-</u> <u>Eleven</u>.  They botched the fallback plan, they...
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
Your mom made that all by herself.
No kidding!
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
The contract was stolen.
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
We could live it up and --
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
Did you tell him you did?
The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
Yeah.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
Yeah.
That's them trying to kill us.
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
Flying to Cambodia.
Of course.
I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
In here.
I don't know...
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
I don't know...
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
What are you talking about? Vegas?
VEGAS.
What Vegas?
We're going to Vegas.
When?
Tonight, baby.
You're crazy.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
I'm not going to Vegas.
Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way.
York Ave.
I love Michael...
Then help me--- for his sake...
I think I'll have a coffee.
Shut up.
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
-Okay okay.
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
He's right beneath us.
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
You need my help?
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
No, no, we're fine...
Are you sure?
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
I was in there in him.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
Sister Paul?
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing...  Is there any ketchup around?
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
Doug, I can't just leave you!
You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
I did too!
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
Thank you.
Didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them.
You hate him?
I beg your pardon?
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
We have.  In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
You mean you could use it.
I won't...don't worry.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing, fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin', monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade Moulan Yan.
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
Who's Colson, Harry?
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
It's ok if you are.
Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
Behind in your dues? How much?
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
Well?
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
Oh-oh.
She's got two things to do - carry clothes an' press 'em wrong - an' just let anybody else muscle in...
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
That's right.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
How is that possible?
That's the downside. There is none.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
Please, Letty.
Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
I'm not really hungry.
C'mon. I insist.
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
I don't have a pistol.
'Night, Al.
Like I said, yeah --
Kara, no!
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
Absolutely sure.
We'll find out.
I'm glad.
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
You don't make enough.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again.  Ever!
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
I've been doing good, though.
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
You betrayed us.
Just get outta my bed.
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Ye...
--I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've sewn my father's wounds more than once.
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Berserk nothing. He's the one who's been sabotaging the mission...  Get this on. Hurry!
Get in the car.
Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Here.
That's the way of the world.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
Survival of the fittest.
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
That's it.
I've completely lost their signal.
Can you get them back?
I'm trying.
Got it.
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
Izzat the thing...
Indeed it is.
I did not.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
Tomorrow
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
Why?
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
Who gave you this idea?
Nobody. It just came to me.
Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
It's all I could think of.
We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
I have a radio fix...
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
No, Cole, I...
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Crawfords.
Whatever.
I can't stay on this planet.
No one's traveling in this weather.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
You promised.
What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
Kill drive engines.
No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer.
We felt his presence.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Yes?
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I may call you worse than that.
You'll wreck your raincoat.
Damn if I won't.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Why?
I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
February first.
The same day she supposedly went down.
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
Of course.
I dunno, boy.
Hm?
It's a bitch.
A bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
We've never met.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
Of course. What happened to your face?
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
Sorry. It's important.
I've ordered nothing from you.
This is a gift.
I take no gifts from you.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Get out of here!
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
Put it out, man!
Well, then a third opinion.
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
How tight are these shafts?
I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
Well, he's gone.
Gone?... Where?
He said not to tell.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
Ah no.
Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Ta.  Ta.
Ta.  Ta.
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Get em....
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
My arm is fine. Where are you??
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Right.
It won't?
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
Fuckin' A!
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
The airport.
It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
Sit?
I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session.  Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
Maybe you're right.
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
Why didn't you notify the police?
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
Sure.
A woman wants to be pursued.
Er,... good.
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
Let's find out.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Come on, let's rock.
Rachel Banks?
Fuck you.
Maybe later.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
Most certainly.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
That's a reasonable assumption.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
Doubts?  About what?
About my love for her.
Now wait a minute--
--And confuse him--
--Gerry--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
Hold on!
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
"Undermine?"
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
Oh, come on, Sean--
--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
Oh, that's nice--
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
--I'm not angry at you--
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
--I don't have any anger at you--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
He won't be a failure!
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
He's not you!
Another five years, huh?
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
He's got blood in his eye.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Then do it.
Fine, I will.
Fine, you do it.
Fine, I'm doing it.
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
The fire alarm...
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Clarence Teal.
What did you hear ?
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
I was.
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
Then what do you want ?
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
We can't.
Why?
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
I haven't got the job yet.
Am I home?
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
Are we in Brooklyn?
You're right here, Jake. You just rest.  The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate.  Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up.
I'll die either way.
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
Oh shit, yeah.
Figure you would have tried it already.
You're late, asshole.
Fine, and how are you?
Did you bring that tape?
Yes.
What time in the morning was this?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
They were in a quandary, and
Come on, Lovey.
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
In a quandary.
Which is neutral, no doubt.
Yeah, I think I could.
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Where?
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
I know that.
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Yep.
Anyone else residing there?
Nope.
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
No.
The window...
The refund for Tuttle!
Tuttle?
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
Hang on.
He better be kidding!
Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps!
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
You know, you --
Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.
That doesn't make sense.
Add it to the list.
So what do we do?
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
I was afraid of that.
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
The perfect couple, I should say.
You mustn't take it so badly.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
Don't you ever stop?
No.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
Do you have to quit the play?
I don't know.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
Please, sit.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
Tch.
I don't know how you're gonna top that.
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
It's okay.  Forget it.
But I would like to buy you drink.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Vodka!
Shot of vodka, please.
Thank you very much.
My pleasure.
No.  Something honest.
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
Marty.
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
No.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
For what?
For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
What?
Garry's missing!
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
Gee, thanks!
I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
What is this?
Not too good at small talk, eh?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.
Read it and keep on reading.
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Hey.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
I was gonna bring it back myself.
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
I don't know.
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
You bet I do, sir.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
The most important thing. Is being together.
We can do better. It needed more white.
PUSH!
Uh, Captain...
Fine.  Good.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
You're so right.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
Great.  Give me a grant.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Oh shit.
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
I bet you hear everything I say!
What?
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
Good.  He never doubted you.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
Yes. 
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Now you know.
Surrender!!
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
Something the matter?
Ogg's footprints!
So what do you want me to do?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
I don't work in Toontown.
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
So's the job.
Well.  What about it?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
So?
I've got to find a way to handle it, openly.  Like Brandon.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Yeah. How's Dad?
Will you get the fuck out of here.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
Tommy  ...
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
Watch closely, as Bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin.
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
What time is it?
Eight-thirty.
Eight-thirty?
You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Yes. My treat.
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
I have to find Kelly!
I think she's with Sarah!
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Is she dead?
That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?
Tu sais o me trouver.
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
It's home.
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
I see your point.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
Maybe I already have.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
I'm not afraid of anything...
Listen...
There's a million places to hide around here.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
I hope not.
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
Let's get these things lit.
No thank you.
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
I'll check it.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
I was born outside London, the only son of a minister who was a master at Harrow.  Grandfather was a bishop.  Church of...Church of Eng...
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
I allowed it to escape the City.
Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?
Ta ss'trakyona'...
Nnn... nothing...
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
NO!
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
Seven hundred each.
Going nearer to God!
I see...
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
An accident?
Yes, sir.
But you wanted to.
I was a mentor to her.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
Dorothy Vallens?
Yes.
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
What's what?
What do you want?
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
What?
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Then who did?
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
I don't know.
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
You knew about me.
Don't know. Think of something.
What?
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
How are you, Jim?
Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
What have you got, Egon?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
Lock fuel rods.
Locked.
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
Not a chance--I'm through. 
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Reed?... Sue?
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
So do I.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
They payin'?
How did Nicky collect?
No.
Well -- where are you going?
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
Never mind.
Tough break.
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--it's urgent!
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
Not when you have no choice.
I hate when you say that.
Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
... until he found tungsten.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
A carrot?!
Mio fratello.
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
He did it to make you stay with him!
Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine...
Why would Harry go back to using a code?
How are we going to get out there?
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
Great.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
If I say no?
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
I don't have to.
The Secret Service?  Why?
Bullshit.
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
Just walk away from me, Taylor ..
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
It's all right, sir.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
I thought she built it herself.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Why?
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
How?
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
...Definitely...
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
What are you down here for to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
Nolan... .
Ted?  Are you there?
Yeah.
Any prospects?
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
How the hell are you going to do that?
I don't know.
Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
I meant everything.
Chang! Chang! Chang!
You mean a picture?
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
I don't see anything.
Squint harder.
Please, Ted.
Try this one.
This is like nursery school.
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
The creature?
Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
You go in for dangerous things.
Darned if I don't! 
I wonder what's got into them?
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
There ain't.
Then what do I do?
Know it, and go on out the yard. Go on.
Uh, huh?
What did you do when you were little?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
Me an' you both.
Congratulations.
Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
Hey, just so long as you see Him.
It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
Shit.  Hi, honey.
Oh... Hi, John.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
No, that's really unneces --
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Thanks, Lloyd.
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Uh ... thanks.
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
Stop it!
Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
Yes, ma'am, it is.
I'll give you fifty cents.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! 
What was that?
Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
Not as yet, sir.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
A lie?
An omission. After that -
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
But mama..
Go upstairs I said!!
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I feel much better. Thank you.
Are you comfortable here?
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
We're nuns!
I can take it.
They've become what you wanted. They're a crew.  That's why he came.
We're too young.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
Juliet who?
In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. Well, not <i>that</i> much older.
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
You sound real remorseful.
That's all you're bringing?
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
What time?
I dunno...
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
I have to talk to you.
I'll be back later...
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
No, sir, we did not.
Switches are shorted out.
You're shitting me!
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
We'll be waiting. Over.
Good winds and bad winds!
Habit, mostly, just like this.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
Will you lighten up, please?
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
Sorry, mistress.
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
There's only one I want.
Which one!
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
You've been working on this, huh?
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
What did you see?
A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing.  I don't want to talk in here.
Is that right?
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
Yeah!
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
You're right.  We should build a collection first.
What if I call you Nicky?
My wife used to call me that.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
Be nasty.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
He will not!
Then he will die!
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
You...you can't.
Of course I can. I have a note from mother.
Out?
Yeah... Maybe just his arms.  Put some Cerulean Blue there.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
She did a Harriman.
Wow.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
Bela died.
There was a change in plans.
What product.
The heroin. You don't have it.
No I don't have it.
No. You don't.
That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
He did it.
You're OK?
Yeah.
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
They were out of line --
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
I'll work it off.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
What?
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
So, that's it. I'm out?
I didn't say that.
Then what are you saying?
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
I don't understand.
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
No.
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
I know.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
Yeah. Sorry.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Yeah.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
Ruiz knows about this?
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
You told him you liked him.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
He'll work it off.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
You vouch for him?
That would hardly be possible.
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Thank you...  Oh no, don't put it on there...
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Let's cancel.
Is my family here yet?
Down front as always.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
How are you, Lou?
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Summer colds are the worst.
Yeah, they are.
When we get here.
Not to expect you tonight.
We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
Why do you think I was hiding?
Mr. President!
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
No way they could have seen it?
Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why?
MMmmm.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
Do you?
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
It was bad, wasn't it.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Yeah.   I think so.  Mike!  Keep it down, for chrissake!
The pleasure is mine.
I'm not applying to college.
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, lets go...
I'm going to hit you.
There's no motels around here.
No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Where's Audrey?
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
What?
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Me!? You where the one...
Go in there. Talk to her.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
I'm okay, you go.
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
What the hell is going on here?
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
I SHOULD have been -
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
But I am not human. I am only -
Spock, you want to know something?
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
Really?
Really...
Erased...
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
What?
Mr. Castro.
Yes.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
I don't think we can treat this as a formality.  Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba.  But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing.
Stanzi!
No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
Maybe before the event, never after.
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
Are you solid with that?
No. I think it's fucked.
Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
Can you loan me a 20?
Sure. Why?
I'm going to the store.
I think you're overreacting.
For now.
What did these Vancouver factories do?
My God, you've got one?
I will when you're finished writing it.
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
All right.  What do we do now?
We wait for Robert to wake up.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
Then prove her wrong.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
So you're gonna act salty all night?
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
What happened to Sway?
She left...
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
Eduardo.  Rama.
You're home, then.
Yes.
Why?  Where are you going?
Where we'll always be...
But.
Hush, baby.
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
What?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Hey, I got no choice.
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
When?
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
You chickenshit punk...
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
No.
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
Hi.
What are you doing.
Feeding my fish.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
Yes.
He's getting big.  Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.
You mean about that gun?
That ain't a gun any more.  The firing pin's busted - the -  Don't waste time talking about that.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
Nothing.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
No, but I certainly shall.
Jerome Lundegaard?
Yah!
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Yah.
My patience is at an end.
Yah.
Good day, sir.
...Yah.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
It better be good.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
No.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
A vote is before the group.
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
Eighty million doll --- ?
And this - if you decide to take the rest.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So who are you?
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
So where are you?
Your front porch.
I will be.
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
Why should I be?
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
What do you mean?
You know it and I know it.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Everything, but everything.
Oh, Laura.
"Oh, Laura..."
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
So, what's your point?
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
No.  Not yet...
You OK out there?
Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
Claire.
She never mentioned you.
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
... yer ducts.
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
... new washer.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
... get to it.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
For the focuser?
Ah-ha!
I beg your pardon.
Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys.
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
His mother's side.
His mother's an only child.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
Stay here.
Alex, please.
Stay in the truck.
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
Forty-eight years...
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
I don't think you're very polite.
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Shit, yeah. Close it up.
Yeah. Bye.
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
I don't know, Jim...
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
Why would you want to be a cop?
I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
I own a brownstone on this block.
Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
Back where?
Sign.
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Yeah.
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
Yeah.
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Nah, man...
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
What's that, sir?
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
Anybody can see that.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
It's not closing, Mike.
That's impossible.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
What time did you make it for?
Eight.  That okay?
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
Really?  Well, come on, then.
What?
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
Yeah.
Is that all you have to say?
What am I supposed to say?
Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
I see that! That's great!
I don't like that story.
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
Right. Who called?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
...and you're going to do that?
Yes.
You're going to settle out of court?
The Tooth...
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
Thanks a lot.
Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
You didn't like them.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Would you sleep with them?
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Nothing... just tired.
What did you say?
I'd think about it.
The Vice-President...
Oh... right...  You know, ever since the stroke...
We have no use for your kind.
This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
That's right.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Exactly.
Why did you come here?
So that others would know about this place?
Why should they?
Because it exists.
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
Marylin.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Let him gamble.
Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to...
<u>I don't know why</u>!
As they used to say... all systems are go.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
Coward.  Giving up.
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Really?
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Oh...
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
Like what?
He didn't?
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
He's better off this way.
Nobody's better off this wav!
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
As you wish.
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
Oh, Christ.
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
What?
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
I called my dad.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Uh-huh.
You don't still think it was me?
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
What will they be made of?
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Silicon is from sand.
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
I haven't the slightest idea.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
No.
Yes.
Yeah.
Why're you crying?
I'm not crying. 
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
You think so?
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
Don't bother.
No--thirty-five! 
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Not the happiest of memories?
Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
Oriental medicine.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Why does she come to you?
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches 
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
You too.  Good luck!
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
Appropriate?
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Very well.
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
No.
Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired of your attitude.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry.
That's...
...fine.
I ain't playin' that.
 Shut up.
I did?
Aren't you happy?  Don't you feel proud...?  I feel proud and all I did was watch.
Thanks.
Do you want some food?
What things do you think you've done?
Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back.
If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Don't bother.
You don't seem to understand.
So what if I don't?
Oh that's nice for you.
Answer what?
What if it's Kara?
Apparently it's huge.
I think I should come with you.
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
What little boy doesn't?
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
About how fast was I going?
The Other Side got to him.
How bad off is he?
Brain injury.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we're after. That's why we have to operate --
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing.  I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
I don't know you, man.
Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis.  Exhibit A.
Clench your teeth.
Wh... what... ?!
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
Shake hands with your daddy.
Where's the pinto going?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Where's Turley?
South of here, past Chimayo.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
Yeah, maybe a bath.
I don't want to.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's not that.
What then?
It's stupid.
It's fun.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
No you couldn't.
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Sir, may I --
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
I don't know what to do anymore.
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
They survived above.  Became what they are.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
It can't all be like this...
Jesus all right enough!
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
She can fuck?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Did what take?
How long did you fuck her?
Doctor Heller?
Yes!
It's me... Elizabeth.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Thanks.
How's your dad?
He's dead.
Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
What do you mean?
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
Yes.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
Yes. On my torso.
If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an <u>accurate</u> idea of what we're talking about.
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
Well...um...her.
You were right.  I get it.  You're not the marrying kind.  You've made your point.  Goodbye Bruce Wayne.
Civil?  I'm civil.
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
Dad's home, already?
In the bedroom.
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
Yes. I think that's very fair.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
It's important, sir!
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
Aw screw it...
Goodbye, darling!
Sure.
No, thank you.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Max--
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
You left out condescending.
But there's another side--
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
I'm the victim here.
Really?
Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
And you were a sympathetic ear.
Exactly.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Does this person have a name?
Lydia.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
I'm a toy to her.
A toy?
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
What happens if you level with her?
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
And why should she?
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Big bites.
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
He was trying to steal my car!
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
It certainly is...
Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
You just said he could eat anything.
You ever eat fifty eggs?
I said, kneel!
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
What do you remember?
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Tell me.
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
You are?  She's glad I called!
Can you borrow me a dime?
Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...
You use their witness.
That's right.
I think we tried that.  The case is over.
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
No. Not at all,
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Not that I know of.
Groceries maybe? A package?
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Oh, I see.
Want to ask him?
Never mind.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
As soon as the peasants stop pawing her.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Oh, lucky him.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
Theo wants to talk again.
Did you have to tell her my name?
Look out of that window.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
Alright. I'll be right up.
Oink! Oink!
Uh ... yes ...
Thanks.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
You were wearing your belt.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
Yes...
Are you sure?
Mother and Father said so... you know?
Whatever.
I didn't forget.
You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
So your name's not Gorsky.
Don't believe everything you hear.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
If only I could have been with you.
There were rats, Dad.
Rats?
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
They want my diary.
Yeah?
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
Why yes. How did you know?
Lucky guess.
That's right.
Figures.
Want to tell me what went down here?
Racist asshole came at me.
Exactly what happened then?
I killed the motherfucker.
...Okay...
What is it?
How the hell should I know?  Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!
I understand.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
Why did you do it?
I'll come along.
Comical?
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
How can you store an energy field within you?
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
That's where my father was killed.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
They use the Bogan Force.
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
Why not?
It would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
It never happened.
What?
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
Sister! I'm his sister!
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
Remember one thing.
Sir?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
Yes sir!
Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Lili... I love you!
And I love you, my husband.
Let's go see.
But what if...
Count to twenty.  Ill be there.
Pleased to meet you.
Pleasure to meet you.
[I believe you.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[Who's he?]
[The one who transferred Pinta to their car.]
What'd you do, honey?
Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...
Where's Harry?
That's what we want to find out.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
I don't know.
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
Did you do everything I asked you to?
Yes.
You told her I never said I love you before?
Yes!
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
Yes!
And you think she bought it?
I'm pretty sure she did.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
She bought it.
I'll be in touch.
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
What is it?
You want --
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
That means I can go alone?
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
Who?  Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.?
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
Let her go.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
Thank you.
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
Justin.
Skipper, you gotta help me...
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
Marvin A. Pickles.
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
Yes, I was.
There's nothing to see.
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
What are you getting at?
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
Yeah.
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
Yes, I do.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
Yes.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
Yeah!
Why not?!
Let's get it over with.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
He wants 75 back.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
Did you hear that?
Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
A coke.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Thank you, ma'am.
We want to talk freely.
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
Just drunk enough.
We'll see.
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
I certainly do!
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
No it's not!
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Well...yeah. Okay.
Ram it in and break it off!
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Why not?
Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.
An invasion...
Yes, sir. We can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove Castro so this can never happen again.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Stop! Take me back!
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
We're letting them slide?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
But, Edward...
Do it.
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
I was planning on waiting until I got the place cleaned out, but -- like the man says, carpe diem.
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
This is fascinating.
Of course it is.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
I wrote that with my heart.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
I will not have it butchered.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
I don't know.
What month?
December twenty-first.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
Thank you.
I want you to do this work.
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
I don't care.
Yeah.
Wait a second --
Cut the crap and read it.
That's GREAT!
Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
Fun -- look at that guy...
It's just the dope, don't worry
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
Not me.
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
Why not? I need to get in there!
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
Oh, tell the story.
I hate it too.
Ruth Rabino.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
The same.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
What?
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ...
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
No.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Oh.
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
You understand?
Did they catch...?
Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Uh, almost.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
And a damn fine one, I might add.
Then they can watch.
He got in here how?
Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything.
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
N-no...I mean...you bet.
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Do you miss Mallory?
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Then was it worth it?
Was what worth it?
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
Hey!
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Yeah. That was me.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
Are you trying to insult me?
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Well, you shall see.
When is she supposed to return?
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
Hello.
Who is this?
Who is this?
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
What do you know about obsession?
Not much.
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
Amen.
Awaiting his arrival.
What about the cat?
Completely unaware.
Huh!
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
How much do you want on it?
All the words you've got.
Where's some paper?
He's having a heart attack or something.
Let's go!
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
Give 'im a fryin' pan. 
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
...Later.
Yeah?...
Yeah.
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
But he's not the right guy!					  *
Excuse me?
I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Make out with you for free.
What's that?
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
I	know what a burrito is.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
What's inside?
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
Okay. I promise.
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
What're you getting at?
If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
Along the Optic Nerve to the Eye.
You knew. You just didn't care.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
Don't you mean what you do best?
Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman.
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
Why didn't you stop me?
Well...I don't know.
That's what I like.
Which thing?
Either one.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
That's one way to put it.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
Professionally?
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
Delirious.
Jesus!
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
I get the feeling you've done some business before.
Really Biff? The keenest?
Oh yeah.
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
No, I told you...
No.
Good.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
I guess I did.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Sweet.
We're leaving them?
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
Yessir!
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
Really?
Yes.
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
Could be risky.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
Afraid of getting caught?
Maybe.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
I'm intrigued.
You're intrigued?
Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
What do you suggest?
I guess I'd ask you why.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
You're not crazy.
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Hello, Quince.
Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
Hi. You forgot your bag.
The enemy is matching velocity.
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
It's my Bullworker.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
What's gone?
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Oh, be still my heart.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
I like jazz ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Elvis I like, too.
Oh yeah, he's good.
I told you.
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
How do you know they're not?
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
No shit? Dick, that's great!
Yeah.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Okay.
What's your friend's name?
Jack.
You love him?
I don't know.
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
Where?
It's a secret.
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Well I was uh, just looking...
Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
No need to be modest, Brian.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
I have a job.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
I don't want them to love me.
I need you out there.  It won't be like last time.  The war's crippled the Democrats.  I can win ... We deserve it.  Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last.  Nobody knows better than you.  Frank Nixon's boy.
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able to get my work done....
Is it bad?
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
I wanted to let his family know....
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
Plato!
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
You lost your mom...
But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
They give you copies to burn.
Appreciate it, sir.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
Bill...
Huh?
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
I'll try.
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
And cut that out right now.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
As of this moment you're six years old...
What is that sup...
And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love.  How inconvenient.
A wreck.
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
Fools!
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
Time to check with Flavors.
...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
Let's go.
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Let me take a look at that map.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
It's down the hall.
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
What do you want, Biff?
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
What do you want, Biff?
Where's your old man?
Fine.
Beautiful.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
I cant tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
From your office, sir.
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
I'll be back at 9:00.
Sure--sure--wait a minute now--simmer down--
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
It's fractured...
Just keep me covered.
Do it to ourselves?
We have to stick with the plan.
Stick?
You steal a car?
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
What you doing to my nephew?
Ah, baby...I thought this was you.  Craig, what are you doing to me?
Let's eat.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
What of it?
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
You're calling me a crank?
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
I think this is number three...
That's an opinion, not evidence...
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
It's readin' right.  Look!
So you're in?
Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.
Meaning?
Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
I have a brain.
We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Will you give Mom a break?
Good.
Come with me?
You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
Food doesn't agree with me.
I'm leaving too.
Why?
This business is over.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
I'm just on vacation.
Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
Huh?
You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
Yes.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Tell me about her again.
Why?
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
She was beautiful. Perfect to me -				*
Rule of thumb?
Yeah?
Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
Never, sir.
What about witnesses?
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
And what do they say?
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
Oh, that's not a problem.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
Some of them have to be automatics.
Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
What?
What night is it?
...Friday?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
Lubbock?
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
You're making the right decision, sir.
I like it too.
A hunger strike? For what?
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
Why can't we?
I don't know the condition of the compartments.  Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
I most definitely say I am.
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
I'll take two.  One for later.
About what?
Name something.
Then why go back now?
Still trying to figure it out myself.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
She didn't see.
That doesn't matter.
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
Bye, Barry.
I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
That this was going to be a key party?
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
Well?
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
Damn it, Ben --
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
You're not going to --
I'm not.
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
Elena.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
Is this marked money, or what?
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
You're just saying that.
General Lee, sir!
Get these men back in line!
Eight forty-two, sir.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
I am, Gaston.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Have you?
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
No, sir.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
No, sir.
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
He might have hurt somebody.
But he didn't.  We've got him where we want him.
Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Huh huh. You mean like this?
Oh. Right.
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
Yes.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
It's not bad, it's ok.
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
Sorry.
Feast your eyes.
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
I am... I was a pianist.
A pianist.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
No.
You look nervous.
I'm not, I'm very happy.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
I don't believe it.
That what he says. Right?
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ...  Those curves don't kid around.
Aye, sir.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Oh, is that it!
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
Smitty.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
Oh, darling!
I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.
You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
No. Thank you. Ill be fine...
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
She's going to leave you -
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
She was going to leave you anyway -
More to the point. Where's our host?
Can I get you anything?
Maybe a brandy.
Sure.
I'll be down in a minute
O.K.
I believe I can bring him back.
All this from watching the.. historical records?
We done?
Yeah.
I don't mind if I do.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Bon voyage.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
What did it cost?
Fifteen dollars.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
It's all I could afford.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
I don't know what you mean.
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Okay. For the dollar, I give you McGann *and* Bill and Carl. I got Paine.  Hello... Oh, yes.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
We're crossing the threshold!
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
Maybe milking.
Milking?
Cows. You know, cows?
I've seen pictures.
Good, you start tomorrow.
You're at Paul Owen s.
Who?
Paul Owen.
I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
I guess that means it's okay.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
I can live with "great."
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
Just two. So far.							  *
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
You what?
This is all terribly wrong.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Are you afraid of me?
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Is this -- what?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
You can admit that, can't you?
Are you kidding?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Wait a minute!
On your first time --
Who said it was my first time?
That you're afraid --
Wait a minute.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
INADEQUATE!
Catch my death.
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
If you like.
Ohhhh -- it's me!
Can I smoke?
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
Yes...  ... father.
Getchmis...?
Olsun - "May it pass quickly." I'm Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich something Swedish.
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
You just got here....
Children are never satisfied.  I have my house, my friends, my job...My life, Michael.  I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back.  Now show your mother what a good dancer you are.
Huh?
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...
You hated West more than any of us.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
Where's Catherine?!
I don't know where she is!
I've never met a human woman.
Oh, but they can!
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
Yes?
Like you couldn't believe.
That's not your mother, that's a man!
It is so hot in here.
How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Okay.  I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
I have. Double-strength!
What?
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
Please, be quiet.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Hey... don't knock librarians.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
It's my bird book.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Just go!
Why is this?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Charming.
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
What is it? Here!
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Cancel lunch.  Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts.
The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
And now, drum roll please...
Hope youre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
What kind of project?
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
Twenty-six months.
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
What's the other one?
What?
Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Oh my god, what happened?
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
The Department of Public Health...
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
They're liars and cowards.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
It's the truth....
You like her?
I love the way she writes.
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Sure, why?
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My fingers on the trigger, you hear!
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
My suitor?
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
He has proposed to me twice.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
What's wrong?
About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
When one sees you they all see you.
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
You can't stop me.
Huh?
After I did "Dracula," the studio offered me "Frankenstein"!  But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough.  It was too degrading for a big star like me.
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
Why did you look at me that way?
I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but <u>clean</u>.  Just dressed--in the middle of the...
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
How was I in the wrong?
Not really.
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
Thanks.
Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
You don't have to be a jerk.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Oh, my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
That's right, of course.
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
But you're his brother.
He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
Sir?
Weve got him!
Try again.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Try again.
Sid, it's useless!
I said - try again.
Tell me... what else did you have?
Well, a hat...
What was it like?
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
An evening gown.
Evening gown?
A dress you wear in the evening.
What do you wear in the morning?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Yes.
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
And there?
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
You feel it, though.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
What is it, Anna?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
You want this?
Just for the honeymoon.
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
So you're chicken?
Who's chicken? 
How?
You tell me.
Why?
You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission.
No, the children sleep with me.
Give them to Refugio.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Which mean physically going outside.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
Sing!
Yeah. Catch you later.
We work down in the ditch?
No.
Guess I got a little scattered.
It's a shitty  song.
That I cannot.
They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts...
Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
That's not what I meant.
It's exactly what you meant.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
-- Permanently?
Do I want to be with you permanently?  Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live?  That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Godfather.
Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
You don't want to be Sheriff.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
You've got your mother, your kids--
They've got me. Different thing.
How much?
$383.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
You know it's for you.
He could be brought back.
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
I know, I met him.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
He must've beaten us all here!
How many kids do you have?
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
Eight children! 
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
That's amazing.
There was nothing to it.  It was my pleasure.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
I'm not staying out here.
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
I'm your landlady
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
Yes.
What happened to you after ...
Your face ... are you hurt?
No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...
Sure. Yeah.
You bet the ponies?
Me? No. Not really.
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
Why?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
This one?
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
Pshhh...
A million. Easy.
She was fast, huh?
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
That's why they call it the smart money.
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
Then I'll leave thee.
Tempt not a desperate man!
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
DELETE IN CUTTING 		) There . . .  A place called . . . Houston . . .
Is that good?
Shut up!
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
I'll be back.
What's it to you?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
Till 19-fucking-70.
How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
You don't need anybody.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
Oh ... hello ...
Quick!
Why?
You are in great peril.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Well, I hope he wins.
What's that?
I'm not fond of television comedies.
Is that where you're family lives?
Murman!
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
Late for what?
Don't be dense. The party.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
Be nice.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
I'll need him.
There are men in this world who demand to be killed.  They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me."  Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.  Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.  I think you have done the same with this man.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
How'd you get here, Earl?
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
Why should I ?
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
I'm not fucking him..
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
How'd you know where he was?
I found out.
And you didn't tell the Police?
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
South African women are very sporty.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Well.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
I am lonely, Yuri.
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Meurice...
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
An old man's dream.
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
Decipher?
Yes. What do they... stand for?
They're just words.
Yes, I understand  but where do you take them from?
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
What are they?
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
You mean like an ape?
Nice voice.
That's not what I meant.
Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
Sure you do --
They're moving pretty fast.
She's left.
Is she coming back?
No.
Why?
But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
Yes.
You don't have that one, do you?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good".  I lost my title but I won a watch!
Yes.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...
I'm not sure.
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
No.
No, we're not.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
I'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but I'm kind of pressed for time.  So hand over the diamond, Garden Gal, or I turn you into mulch.
Perhaps
Oh, sure.
No.  Not yet.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
Fine. Just fine.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Yeah.
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
Who are they?
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
Maybe they just want to appeal.
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
Where did you get those pants?
Three cheers for our champion.
Utah?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
What about finding the source?
I have some ideas.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
Go to transportation, get a ticket.
You first.
How about both of us at the same time?
But wishes don't come true.
Certain wishes do.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
But this is different.  Go on blow,
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
So, even if I did say them, I was sincere with her, as I am now with you.
How?
I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Is this paper even good?
Check the scrawl.
R.K. Maroon.
Norman Spencer.
Truck.  Of course.
'63 Chevy.
I knew it.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
Oh, really.
In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
No.
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
I don't remember.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
You want to make it like this? 
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Where does he hang out?
I don't know.
Where!
Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest.
Because you're nuts.
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98.
Never even heard of anything like it.
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Then he saw.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
What good will they do?
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
Okay.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
You don't need a lawyer.  We found the program on your laptop.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
A half hour in the lobby.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
Yes.
Where do you want to go?
Take me home.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
What are you then?
I'm alive.
Then what are you doing here?
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
What isn't happening?
Let me out of here!
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
We're losing the war, aren't we.
It kind of looks that way.
Pistols?
Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
No.
Nick...
Get your own room.
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
Thank you.
Well, how's it going back there?
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
Know the Millertown bluff?
A pocketful of rye...
Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
You never had trouble communicating before.
I'm prepared to take the blame.
What are you talking about?
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
...Are you sure we want that?
Why me?
That would complicate things.
Because I'd be to blame, right?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
He knows that?  Billy?
Yes.  He does.
Billy said that?
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Let's get something straight, Chappy!
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
Howd you do this year, Tony?
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
Manifested?
Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --
We know what it is, Al.
I ought to smack your face!
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Where are you going?
For a ride.
Wait, away?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
To his hotel?
Shit, Jeff!
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
Can't complain.
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Sure, right.
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
I'll be right back.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
"Our" car, Walter?
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
Everybody knows --
Who brought you here?
What the fuck is going on?
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
At me friend's house.
Where's that?
Wilton Estate.
Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
I can't do it.
You've just done it -
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. 
You already asked me that.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
See about closing.
Yessir.
What time do you close?
Now. We close now.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Generally around dark. At dark.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
Is that what Argon told you?
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
You're afraid of him.
Who isn't?
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
Yo, can I have my locker back?
You guys have been so colossal...
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
I think it's coming now...
Global warming?
Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
Its'...ah...about my daughter....
What?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
How's that?
Tonight.
No sound at all?
No, it was a table.
Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Yeah.
No pistol. Ever.
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Okay, Mr. Book.
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
You think there were other men involved, Russell?
Nothing.
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
Someone must've pulled the records.
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Don't push it, Larry.
You're burned out.
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
Yeah.
Hell, good luck!
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Thanks!
I have a flair for drama.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
You wanted an answer to your question.
Annette?
You just go when I say go.
Should have at least gotten the map off of him.  Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
What's my problem? You want a list?
You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
The drink WAS served...
Lois, I . . .
I was right. you are Superman.
Oh come on, that's ridic -
Okay.
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
Fuck off, Barry.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Haven't seen it.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
Not really.
What?
You know how to drive a stick?
It is for me.
Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it.  Something!
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time.
Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
Live there?
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Wait a second--
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Then you'll be my best man.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
What do you mean?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
I guess so.
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
Of course.
So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Double strength!
Yes, sir --
Why they call you that?
Call me what, sir?
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
A sauciere --
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
What are you doing out here?
Cook school -- that did it.
How?
They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
What's your theory?
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
Floater?
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
Let me know when you've identified him
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
All of them created by people like me.
What?
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
No, no. Leave them for a while.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
Forget her!  Move on.  A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
Not according to these.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
Incredible.
The Emperor has given him permission.
My... husband.
I am husband?
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Well, preferably in tens and twenties...
I don't think, he can't...
...just wait...Dad...you want something...can you say...
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
Right.  So we should've been able to cover more of them.
Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
No. No, no.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
I want to go home, Merle.
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
This is horrible!
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
Merle, I wanna go home!
-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
What were you thinking?
Yum, yum.
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
I heard.
You killed Santa Claus?
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
Maybe this is heaven.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
But I'm not hungry, are you?
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
There aren't.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
Let's hear it.
The milkmaids.
The milkmaids?
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
I remember that deal. You were involved?
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
He's the owner...
Why don't you want a message sent?
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
Why
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
Sure.  Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my investigation of Hiss back in '48.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
Oh.
Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
I can't
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
...Who is this?
Chet!
...Who?
Chet! From downstairs!
Keep looking.
What're we looking for?
Any irregularity in the pattern.
What?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
It's your birthday?
Yeah.
Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
No.  I'm assuming the cave-in begins with the threat of litigation from Big Tobacco. Are we talking... are we talking Brown & Williamson, here?
Buff is funny. God.
Don't be an idiot.
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Shells?  Whatever for?
I think you liked it with him.
Hold it a minute.
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
That's Lila?
Let them eat static.
They're still running with shields down.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
That's not what you said last night.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
A little?
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
What does old Stew want?
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
Who cares!
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
I'm educating myself!
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
is very angry.
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
Well I don't...
Wait. He left.
Would that Marcus had lived.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
He killed his father and then my family...
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
Yes!!!!
The scar.
There is no scar. I'm telling you.
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
Why?
They want to hold you in Contempt for ethics violations.
Dieter?
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
No, you guys are great together. He'll come through, I'm sure.
Say, Hildy...
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
No way...
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
Yeah.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
Yes.  Always have had.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
No.  What's that?
Big feet -- large shoes.
So you think we got 'em scared?
It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
I have a job.
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.
Whatever you want.
Fine!
Fine.
What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
Leave him.
No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
I'm thinking about it.
Michael...
No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.
That's it.
Okay, so that's it.
Is there one in these waters?
What makes you think there might be?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Probably.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
And sound.
Sound?
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
So there's one around here.
Not necessarily.  These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more.  None of them are immediately fatal.  Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
We'll have to re-stock some basics.
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
Never enough.
But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
Call the police.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Wow!
I'll just try the first one.
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
You try. You try talking to her.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
I give up.
Don't ask me.
Tell me!
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
Is it true?
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
Can India help us?
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
Britain?
Britain chooses not to.
And, America?
America, we shall see.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
Yes sir.
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Research. I worked the scene right into my story.  That makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
It will not happen!
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
They'll be here...
Baines is packing up?
Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears
Why now, Jimmy?
'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to lose you.  And for some reason I get the feelin' you're about to split. Permanently.
What... what do you mean?
It's out of your hands.
Eighteen.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
Conklin.
He's dead.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Dad, I love him.
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
Last year? It can't be that long.
Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace  and made it into a lamp for my night table?
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
Me?  Why?
We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad.
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
I think that's it.
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Come on, damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair, you know.
You going to be all right?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
You ask them.
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
What complicated about it?  All you have to do is do what you're told -- what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it's bursting my ears -- but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!
NOOO!
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Yes.
Oh, man, there you go again.
What?
Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
That's right.
Can we dream?
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
"You could be swinging on a star."
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
Thirty-four seconds!
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
You're fuckin' good.
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
Homework?
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
The what?
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
I don't know, are we?
Please, please.
Uh-huh.
Any idea where I might start looking?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
All you want is a phone number?
Well, I know you're busy...
Don't play games with me, Ted.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
I don't buy it.
You don't buy what?
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
Yes?
My name is Travis.
Thank you, Travis.
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Where're you off to now?
Good question. You took the bait.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
In a bit.
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
Quiet!
Ohhhhhh!
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Don't be late.
Not yet... Section 4236...
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
Did you learn anything?
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Did you talk to him?
He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
I just want to double check the facts.
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
We gotta hook up.
Sure. Where?
P.J.'s.
I'll be there.
We need milk....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
We need beer....
I'll be right there.
Excuse me, sir...
Did they get my contracts?
I know, I know.
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Chances of recovery?
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
No.
Are you dead?
No.
What are you doing?
I think I'm floating.
Why would you be floating?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
What about her?
Of course...
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Tell me about the purity.
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
I'm sure we will.
Describe Mallory.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
That's indescribable.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Says who?
Says the United States of America.
When have they ever been right?
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
Thanks.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?

Paris?
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
-- sir? --
-- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --
I want it --
But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina.  Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness.  Do you want it that much?
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Yes, please.
What'll it be?
Whiskey.
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
Okay, okay.
At least somebody likes this shit.
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
Some of what?
Extract of pineal!
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Right!
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Yes!
...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
I need my sodding parents' consent.
Excuse me?
Transient or resident?
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the night clerk. I can always ring out for sandwiches.
What?
Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!!
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
Chickenshit money.
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
Yes, sir.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
Ah, well...
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Greetings, program...
You're alive!
Yeah, I... oops!
Stand up.
I said I'm fine.
It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
You mutant bastards...
Tell me it's not a mirage.
What?
Your mother?
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
Your father is proud of you.
I am the Borg.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
Where?
On the street.
You promised you'd never ask me.
After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  No one would tell me anything.  All I know is what the police told me.  We have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  What happened?
Probably didn't have time.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Much less than that.  An hour and a half.
How could I ever leave?
It may not be your decision to make.
What?
You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
Yes, it was.
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
Does it matter?
Sure. By shooting at me.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
I don't even know your name yet ...
My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
A page-break signal.  A period.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.
What?
My ass if falling.
Your what...?
My ass is falling.  It is.
What are you talking about?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Get in bed.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
HoS qorDu. 
Master Hardenbrook...
I just pulled and it - it came off.
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Look, it's really not my fault.
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
I feel good.
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
Nope.
Claude.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
What do you want, Claude?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
You still got that map?
Yeah.
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
On your behalf. What happened to we?
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
Like what?
There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs.
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
Keep your eyes open.
You gave them me.
I gave them me.  Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.
The lockdown thing.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
-- it wasn't me.
Rewind that.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
Then who did??
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
It works.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
What else could it be?
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
<u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony.
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
I can't comment until I get paid.
No. Not yet he isn't.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
He is. Take my word for it.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
On the contrary, it could be just the ticket.
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
Cool.
At Rekall.
Who are you?
What?
There he is!
Thanks for pointing that out.
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Because you want to.  You've always wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look at your sculptures.  Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you.
Good to meet you.
Attempted murder.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
Even poor people have T.V.s
Yes.
Where's the walk-in safe?
Behind you.
What's the combination?
I'll do it.  Just let me find my portable phone.
LATER, MAN!!
I didn't.
I hope the block is still standing.
We're still standing.
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Andy!
I don't believe it...
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
I'm sure they're around.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
Of course.
You won't forget it?
I won't forget.
I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I?
Only silence. It's always like this.
And no birds sing.
No birds live here.
No.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Sophie.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
I'm waitin' here for a name.
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Well I...
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Well not much.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
We had feared we were the only ones...
But how did you come into existence?
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
Ready, Baron.
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Why do you say that?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
No. I wasn't adopted.
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
This one walk you home too?
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
Are you saying they won't help us?
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
We're locked into Albania.
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
How?
It was Xavier's people.  They knew.
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
Sit down.
Still doesn't make it right.
I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
I liked him better before he died.
Let it go.
I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch.
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
He needs a haircut.
Yeah, right.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
You can change.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
Don't be so sure.
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Where are the antihistamines?
Very much.
This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
I got my mase.
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
Stuffed and baking.
Yes, you were.
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
Been better, Dad... You?
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Terry, for God's sake.
Get out of my way.
No, I can't let you. I can't, you're
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
What?
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me.
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
Have it your way.  The point is--
It's your roll--
The fucking point is--
It's your roll.
It couldn't have been earlier?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
There you are!
Yes?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
I won't make any noise.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.
That's what Tim said.
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
Yes, I would.
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
You do?
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
The Vice Squad?
That's right, Baxter.
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
What kind of joint are you running?
Sir?
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Who?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Oh.
Are you going to deny it?
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
You better.
Well, about six months ago -- I was going to night school, taking this course in Advanced Accounting -- and one of the guys in our department -- he lives in Jersey -- he was going to a banquet at the Biltmore -- his wife was meeting him in town, and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo -- so I gave him the key    and word must have gotten around -- because the next thing I knew, all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets -- and when you give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand -- pardon me.
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Never mind.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Stop it.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
I'm not.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
You're ruthless.
You're not so bad yourself.
The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.
Me.
Let me do something for myself for a change!
No, she's right.
Do you really want this, Dick?
This.  Above all.
And then you'll be happy?
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.
A little.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
It's the same thing!
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
We are both full of shit.
Yeah, that's right.  Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
But I haven't . . .
I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
Show me your eyes.
I'm sorry, I --
No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
I have it here.
Good.
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
And up a dime.
I don't know, eight or nine.
Where does everyone sleep?
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
I don't want to hurt Charley I don't want to hurt you...
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
I know what you want me to do!
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
That  word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... .
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
What makes you think I'll miss?
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
What is she shooting?
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
Oh can't I? Watch me!
I don't care.  I hate him.
You don't hate him.
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
Don't be silly.
My husband believes in you.  We're gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
Maybe it takes a while...
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
Hello.
I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
What bus?
Yours.
Eight o'clock.
Why, honey?
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
Fuck yeah we will.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
How?
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I don't understand.
I still don't either, even after all these years.
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
I've been busy.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
Since Nancy died.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
I got your card.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
It's embarrassing, okay?
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
Everything... everything's so funny...
We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
Right.
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Hurt!  How?
Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
What do you drink?
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
No, she was heavily sedated.
It's serious?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
When will you do it?
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
Whips...orange whips.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Uh...over easy.
Coming right up.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
As many times as it takes.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Jack?
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
Whatiya mean?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
What do you want?
I want you to hurt me.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
You've heard of me?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
What report?
Huh?
What report?
You mean you don't know?
Know what?
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father.
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
I swear to God!
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
Lower me down.
Where the hell have you been?
Shut-up...
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Yeah.
You just need to get more organized. L
You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
They think you did it.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
Yes, sir.
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Destroy the evidence huh.
Have you ever stolen anything?
Nope.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
Like helping a sick kid?
No, for the Asylum.
Close!
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
They'll never get us.
It's true!
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
Don't you know it!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
What did He say?
HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Yes. I like that very much.
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
Catherine told me what was in it.
If she's telling  you the truth.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
'Just remember you're in training, son'
What was it?
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
A snake!
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
Do we get to wear a crown?
But of course.
Count me in.
Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
What?!
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
We got this far.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
I guess you're right.
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
A woman?
Oh, yeah!
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
How could it not?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Come on now.  People are smart.
No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.
No... I move faster alone. 
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
I'm trying...
I'll worry about Customs.
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
Mom, take it easy.
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
Yes.
What a relief.
This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.
When did she die?
Is...? She's dead then?
What?
I don't know. Something.
A deer?
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
How can we reach Phaedos?
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
See -- you can drive after all!
Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
You want to go talk to him?
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
What do you mean? What's going on?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
A Bill! Not *him*!
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Thanks.
I thought it was appropiate.
Is that good or bad?
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
How so?
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
For real?
Uh huh.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
But I don't know who they are.
I heard.
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
Did you have a good day?
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
Mike...?
An empty tomb?
A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --
What do you think I'm doin'?!
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
I don't know.
Well, I'm not going down there and look.
Mind if I play some tunes?
Of course.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
I have a tiny apartment.
Yeah, I know it's small.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
You don't want me to live with you?
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Mine.
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
No-what, what...? I... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?
Ring the call to quorum.
That's okay.  I love you anyway.
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
Who?
The Queen Mother.  Anne.
We won.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
It satisfied me.
What for?
We follow many.
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
I heard it click.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
I heard it.
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
How did you get your hand out?
No. Sara, you don't understand...
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
Yea?
How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
I'm sorry, John.
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
I have to go away, John.
Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
I'll tell you when.
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
I didn't get it either.
Everybody's too stupid!
I wish I knew. Uhura?
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?
Since his beard was red.
You're breaking my heart.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
So go shower already.
You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them.  You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
Go back to the drawing board.
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
You always were hard to impress.
Who the fuck is it to you?
Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
Yeah, Val.
We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan.
Hmm.
Voila!
That's right.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
All right if I look around your lobby?
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Not at all, lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
I've been a bad boy.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
Which loser?
You know, the green cardigan guy.
Oh yeah.
Cuba.
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
Come on!
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things.
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Help finish the railroad.
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it.  Understand?
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
That's what I thought.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
It means shut up, Thelma.
So this is all my fault, is it.
I have something.
Don't wait for me!
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
Second best.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
Are you mad????
That must be it.
Don't forget you have your brother.
Yeah.
See you later.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
You want to go talk to him?
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Doing what?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
He'd assume we had.
That's something I suppose.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I'm glad.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
I know.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and I wrestled. But when I get with you, and I say to myself, "My God--here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--"
It wasn't important.
He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
I don't <u>know</u>.
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
Nothing?
Nothing you don't want.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
Yeah, but I was really not good.
You didn't know.
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
I still have your virginity!
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
No...
Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!
You didn't?
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
On account of me.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Well...uh...they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
Said "looks clear."
Well, what's it look like now?
Looks clear.
We want to help...!
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
To you ... ?
Ja, ja.
... yeah, that.
You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover.  As they say in the sport biz.
There's no other choice.
We're gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything that's sick and evil about the Eastern Establishment.  You and your "plumbers" are gonna find dirt on this guy -- let's see him going to the bathroom in front of the American public!  And when we finish with him, they'll crucify him!
Almost five.
What's going on?
Great.
Great?
Yeah.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
What?
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
Hold it, hold it. Here.
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Doctor's orders- - -?
Captain's orders.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
Thanks.
For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
I want Debbie.
Cole...
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Five thousand dollars.
No.
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
No. No, you don't.
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
Well, I...
Did you want to talk to me?
It's a miracle.
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
Captain, what have I done -
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
If you think it would help.
You mean John Bubber?
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
You're joking.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
I'm gonna nail it.
I know you are.  Go you Huskies.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Since when?
Your buddy is callin' ya.
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Thanks.
Where'd you get it?
Interested in buying one?
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
I forget.


INT. TUNNEL/AIR VENT - DAY.
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
Oh, that's nice.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Szpilman.
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
Millions - if anybody wants it.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
You get his statement?
I'm taking you back.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
Tell me what?
Yes... My God...
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
Any news of Quaid?
Not since you lost him.
Watch your mouth, Captain.
Precisely.
Uh-oh...
It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
Get in the boat, Rose.
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
I don't know.
But now I kind of like it.
Ask her...
No, no.
Come on, Copper.
It's never happening again. Right?
Right.
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
He got lucky.
Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
No, you were brilliant
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I don't know, I'm afraid.
I don't know either.
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
What other food?
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
Yes.
Absolutely positively.
A serum test possibly.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
This is crazy!
What is?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
What?  What is it?
Were upside down!
You're crazy. We're level.
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
Damnit, where's my car!
-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
We live in a theater?
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Oh sis. You're so tense.
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
You knew them.
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
Always.
If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
He did? When?
While you were in the shower.
Why didn't you call me?
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
What? What do you mean?
He said you didn't have one.
What's he talking about?
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
I don't believe this.
Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight.  Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to say that that sin's been warshed away too!  Neither God nor man's got nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, the water's fine!
Thank you.
Mouse?  What mouse?
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
What happened to it?
I don't know.
What kind of a man are you, son?
You could sell your Beamer.
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
That's a good one.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
It's a good one all right.
Cy... I ain't even sure.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Naw... I gotta...
I hear you. I'll catch you in a bit. Feeling cooped up in there, you know?
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
What ?
Uh-oh.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Yeah. Of course.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What do you mean?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
Who's your candidate?
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
What about Jorgensen?
I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
All right, Bud... let's do it.
For what?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
But you was going to fight for me.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
How old are you?
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
I don't buy that.
It's the truth.
Yeah, it's cold!
I'm hungry.
So I'm still ...
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Foreman now.
No shit.
Five years.
Beautiful. How's business?
Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
An unholy trinity ...
You killed my husband.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Too many cooks --
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
But -- why?
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
I'm okay.
Are you sure?
It's late, Sam.
It's not late, it's early. Really early.
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
For the money.
The money. Yeah. That's a right smart of money...
Hey, Mick!
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Well, you can't always get what you want.
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Good on ya, man.
Groovy!
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
You could do it.
I could.
Yeah!
Yeah.
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
Yes!
Yeah!
A reel?
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.  You may not believe this, Parker,
So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
Walter Livesy.
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Not so good. You sure you have to?
I don't know. Wish I did.
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
One hour!
Drew!
I promise!
Which show was that?
Sofie...
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
You probably got the idea.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
I know!
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
How long have you been here?
Three nights.
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Two or three nights.
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Are you going to be all right?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Take good care of yourself, okay?
You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street.  Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer. 
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
You just feel sorry for me.
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
Sir...?
Close the door.  Sit down.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
Are you O.K.?
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
La da da dalala...
I hate fuckin' opera.
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
It was a clearance.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
You're soft.
What'd you say?
Months, Swana.
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
No. It was someone else.
Who?
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
You liked it there.
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Learning was important?
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Did you have fires at night?
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
It must have been safe.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.
Leave us alone right now.
I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go.
Aye, ma'am.
Yes.
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
Got it.
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
You've been there?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You believe that?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
No charge.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
Two-hundred.
What?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Yeah, but it was shot.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
What sign?
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>.
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
No, really.
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
Mr. Brady's a cop.
I might still have a few chips left.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Other way around, sir.
Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
No. My uncle.
Oh, he's in the Army. I do so like the military, don't you? Those uniforms make men look so virile. I did "What Price Glory?" in summer stock. I played Charmaine - with a French accent.
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
Weiss.
Weiss.
What about the sender?
Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Carlos De Moraes?
Yes. How did...
Thank you, Jane.
Mike, at three and a half...
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
It was a boy.
And Kay...she's all right?
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
I don't know.
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Girl's gotta make a living.
Thank God.
First time I ever heard that.
I was expecting someone else.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
Where was the last place you left him?
Right here in the van.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
Good night, Daddy....
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
The population must increase With great rapidity.  We give a couple seven years To raise a family. If, by that time, there is no branch Upon the family tree, we stand 'em up against the wall - and Pop goes the Weasel.
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
I'm cool.
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
Hurry!
They won't make it.
Where ?
I know.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Are we going to argue?
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Okay.
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
No, I know that part --
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
A sense of humor.
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
It's right in front of us.
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Nice to meet you.
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
I adore it.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
Helluva fuck factor.
See Threepio!  Do you copy?
Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
She never told Eddie, though.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
How'd you manage that, then.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Modelling.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
Kelly!  What are you doing here?
That was a beautiful message.
I meant every word of it.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
Doesn't sounds like him.
Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
What?
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
You mean...and orgasm?
You got it, stud.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
But that one time --
No.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Do you?
Of course.
Do you love her?
Any ideas?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Is that written in his shoe?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Finished, son?
There's only two of them now.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
Sharp.
Snappy.
With a little jazz.
The Shazzammeter!
The Hipster!
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
We'll explain on the way.
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
I will not fight you, father.
Dude. Seriously?
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
Needs brightening ...
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Nasty.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
And what was that?
We're there now.
I'll be fine.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
Because it's my name.
Then who's Russell Nash?
I don't know anymore.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Should we leave a note?
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
Go to your room!  Now!
We'd be the first!
Not tonight.
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
The van?
Is it your vehicle?
No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.
I keep telling myself that.
Won't you join us?
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Thank you.
And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
I have a cold.
What did the thermometer say?
The thermometer's broken.
I believed her, Pete.
If you must know, virtually nothing.
How many men are working with you on this?
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
That's all you've had all this time?
That's it.
I thought so.
Is he in an asylum?
He's dead.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
You ol' fucker!
Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin' a risk of gettin' my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean...
Fucking sweet.
Okay, and... and...
How do I know their voices are --
Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
Yeah?
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
We think so.
Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
Mmm, what?
Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
Best of a nightmare.
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
Maybe she used another name.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
Yes.
I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
Where am I gonna start?
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
'Bout every other night, Red.
With him?
We'll send a squad up.
No need, everything's under control.
With four casualties?!
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
Sometimes twice.
Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
I give up.
You just passed your nemesis.
Where's LUH?
Look more closely.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
But I am also with the government.
Well what am I gonna do with it?
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
You really want to help me?
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
Do one thing for me, before you go.
Yeah.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
In Group?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Intense.
How long were you in there?
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
It was pretty bad, huh?
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
I think we may be, yes.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
Which is shit.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
I'11 find him.
Waste of time.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
What?
Nothing. Something I - forget it.
Well, they will be.
Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
How awful.  What will you do?
A more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  Remind our families we still exist.
We're about to be shown the way.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
And if you don't?
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Would you like me to go for her?
I couldn't ask you to.
I don't mind, really.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
You're going hunting?
What?
I see you're going hunting.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
And how does one do that?
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
Oh yes, of course.
And then killing your sister.
Excuse me?
You should.
You're right.
Get the fuck away from me.
We thought a doctor might help.
Your old beau?
We thought it was an emergency.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
We all are.
Shouldn't you lie down?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
Do you want to come in?
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Mr. Gilroy --
She's not a tart.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
She's not that either.
What are you getting at, Professor?
Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
Where? Where is she?
I'm not telling.
What?
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
Steve.
Fuck you, too Nick.
Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
So-so, Johnny.
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Right.
Piece of cake.
I think it's still available.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
They're dead?
Yes they are.
Stiffs??
Deceased.
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
Where the hell's the beer...?
I just had a phone call.
Tell me, is it bad news?
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
I won?
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
What...?
Oh hey, one more thing?
What's that?
Get me a six pack.
Right.
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Don't you like her?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Then what's the problem?
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
What're you talking about, George?
Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
Thats every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
"Of love?"
"Out of her favour where I am in love."
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
Wait a minute, I haven't handed over punishing privileges to you YET!  Put the whip down and I might respect what you're saying...
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
I don't think that.
Has anyone ever been to Downey?
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian.  Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes.
Believe what?
Her name.  Bregitta.  It's poetry.
I didn't know that.
On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
Panes is not on your team anymore.
Coming about, then.
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Honest to God, Ruben!
I like women like that!
Tell it to your shrink.
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say "Calls for speculation."
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Stop it.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Excuse me?
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
What are you talking about?
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
I didn't say it like that.
You <u>did</u>, you--
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
Just forget it.
Me, too. Every time I walk...
How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
When did he go off chemo?
About three weeks ago.
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
Uh. huh.
I'm really sorry.
He's in here --?
Yeah.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
M'hm.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
Okay. See you here.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
Please, go ahead.
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
The one and only.
Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed.  You still working the trains?
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk?  About what?
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
About what you said this morning.
Why not, Bobby?
She doesn't like me to steal from people.
I do, too.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait.
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
I'm a file clerk.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
That may be what they want us to think.
No kidding.
No, I'm the King of the World.
No.
Following the game at all?
No.
No. Me Neither.
Well, I need that...
...and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's.
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
You promise?
How'd you know it was us?
Security camera.  Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live.
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
Hi.
Heard you had quite a night.
Then who the fuck are you?
Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Oh!
I didn't dive.
You'll try again tomorrow?
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Where's my daughter?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Drop that fucking money!
No Jean, no money!
Is this a fucking joke here?
Jack?  What was that?
What?
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Why was I not informed of this?
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
Are you guys hurt?
...through the kitchen...
No - really, I can see them -- they're coming now - turn off the lights 
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Is that all?
No sweetheart, you can't.
Why not?
He was allergic to bees.
He's okay isn't he?
There were just too many of 'em.
You know better than that.
We don't know of anything, Master...
Then why do you shake so?
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Aaaahhhh.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Say cheese...
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
You're serious.
Quite.
Then the rumors are true?
What rumors might those be?
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
And  I love you, Pete!
What?
Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
The easy way.
What's the matter?
Who's Eichmann?!!?
Homicidal?
What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
It was good of you to meet...
He's right, Williamson.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
I have no knowledge of that.
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
You were with GRUNER!
Tower, here.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Copy, Air Force One.
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
What's wrong.
Give it back.
Try and take it.
Excuse me?
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
I didn't strain. I sighed.
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
I don't think so.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
They are not.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
What about that other guy?
Other guy?
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
Whatever for?
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Beware.
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
And what is your name?
Phoebe.
Phoebe?
I call myself Phoebe.
Why not? Tell me, Phoebe, do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car.
Just get in yours!
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
Piece of fucking cake.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
You think of everything, don't you?
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
Call it a reckoning of character.
Bob...
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
He's only doing what you told him to.
What I told him to?
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
He was only doing his job.
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
Go away, Nosey.
Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
Waste the dude.
I was at Harrow ...
But did they teach you this?
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
...I'm sure you do...
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
...I know. I went...
...You saw her?
Yes. Yes, I have.
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
...fifty thousand dollars?
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
...I understand...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
...I understand...
...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
I can't.
It's not safe for you to be either.
You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
And you're from the future too?
Right.
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
That I cannot tell you.
And we intend to use them!
Where's Bella?
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
You've what?
She's just outside the door.
The heave-ho.
I'll call the whole pot.
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
That French ain't it?
Jack.
Is your bad?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
I'd say we're in its home.
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
That's a good idea.
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
I doubt it.
Maybe -- it's hard to say.
I'm not so happy myself.
I don't think you will.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
You should have called. I have an "O- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.  It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
You're goin' on a trip?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
You should go on a trip.
No thanks.
So what should I do with the pudding?
Let's just leave it there for now.
You started filling out your college applications yet?
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
Bye you guys. _ 88.
No way! He can't!
Sandy, contact traffic control.
You won't die if you let me help.
Bullshit!
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
She'll never understand it.
In time, she will.
She'll think I betrayed her.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded.
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What happened today?
What are you talking about?
Was it something that happened at school?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
True. Should we stop them?
Fry 'em.
One or two.
Audrey?
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
How much?
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
So?
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me about a skag deal?
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
I understand.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
Helpless...
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
Defense against what?
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
I liberated it.
I think that's called looting.
No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
Oh --
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
So?
So now I need you to hack into her.
I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
Why?
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Which means he probably knew her.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
M-E...
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
It's kind of falling apart.
You're not allowed to ask that.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Thanks, Joel.
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
You got me.
A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
You're WHERE?
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
I mean if you knew karate?
No Jeremy.
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
Shut your mouth.
What's that?
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
I always wanted to try that.
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Can I come in for a minute?
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
And something else that might interest you.
I don't want to learn.
You don't want to learn.
No.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
Tired.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
Sure. What do you want to know.
People say he was a murderer.
That's your grandfather you're talking about!  I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.
I can't believe he'd do this.
I know.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
I know.
If you went away, what would become of me?
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
I can't help it.
That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off.  People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
Oh, my, yes.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?  Unbelievable.
Gale?
She's not here right now.
But she's standing right next to you.
You want me to place a few calls?
It's fine.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
There's just one question.
Of course.
Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
Lower the boats!
Who is there?
Will Shakespeare!
"My dear President"...
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
"My dear"...
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
"My President"...
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
"My"...
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
"My dear"...
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
"My dear President"...
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Is that all?
Take another letter...  to my tailor.
He'll never let us go.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
And she got the medium.
Even on sale that stuff's a fortune. I worked all week to pay for a bra.
Who the fuck is he?
Jimmy.
It's him, isn't it?
Maybe.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Why, are you famous?
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
How many was that?
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
That's funny.
I thought so, too.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
No, you didn't.
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Doesn't matter.
Of course.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
Doesn't that scare you?
No.
Why?
Because I think he's wrong.
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
Sir?
You better take this.
And you...are?
Hunting.
When?
Sun up.
Alone?
No.
Ramn -- you can't.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
Yeah, Kay?
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Noon exactly.
Did he say where?
Actually, yeah--
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
How'd you know that?  Kay?
Cause I think we're looking at it.
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
How much longer for the range and power projections?
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
We don't have an hour.  We're already supposed to be shut down.
I'm leaning toward no.
That's your option.  Ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time.  In case you didn't know it, you're crazy.
But I like being human now.
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
He's trying.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
Come on, let's dance.
I think he did it to himself.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
I don't know which numero.
Numero, trois.
Perfect.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Not much, I think.
I'm just like him.
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Did you worry about him?
Nobody worried about your father.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
Howdy, Rhonda.
You're really leaving, huh?
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.
H-hi.
It was nearer than that.
Didn't you tell her?
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
Why?
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
Nobody's asking you to.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
I sat outside and had coffee.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Near the church.
I sat there once. It was hot. Like today. I'd been shopping. I had all these bags around my feet I kept having to move every time the waiter came by...
Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
What I mean is --
We're a team.  We work together.
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
How did you know...?
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
I'm here.
Because you don't really seem here.
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Something's up wi...
You think I didn't get that?
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
Oh Rachel!
Hi, Han... Chewie.
I'll get my kit.
Who cares ?
You're right. Let's never stop...
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
I got my planet back.
Mummy!
What kind of "stuff?"
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
I would.
Got something to hide?
Doesn't everybody?
I could get a search warrant.
If you could, you would have brought one today.
This isn't right.
This is my only chance to get a watch like that.  It would mean a lot to me and my family.  Please take it.  It really isn't that much.
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
As close as a deal could be.
Olympic.
Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
To check up on me?
I'll be around to check up on you.
Why would you be there?
Because I live there.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.  Then send him to Taxidermy.  He's a museum piece.
Yep.
Where does he live?
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes, but where?
Right across the bay there.
Where?
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
So can I come along?
No.
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Okay, okay. You're right.
I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
She never mentioned her father.
Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
With one of them.
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
Could...could you come?
I told you, that's a secret.
Isn't he precious?
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
Where?
Library of Congress.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
Benjamin Franklin, where's that? Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road. It's right arounna corner from my house. I have a cousin who's a teacher. He teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. He was studying to be a Jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
Becker does? Are you sure?
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
What do you care?
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Maybe I dont.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
Kristina's fine.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Yeah.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
George, he wasn't asking.
Let's get it over with.
All right.  What's your name?
So whoever built this--
His journals, letters, maps, books...
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
It's something I've always wanted to do.
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
-- here we go -- I found it --
No.
No man!  <u>Go to your room</u>.
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
Have really held you under?
Marco...
...Polo.
Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
So do I.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
Yeah, maybe.
But Rache...
A <u>suitable</u> boy, will be at <u>this</u> flagpole, <u>on</u> Monday, with a <u>very</u> expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an <u>escort</u> service!
Mommy, where are you?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
When?
Soon, baby.
Mommy, I'm scared.
There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
What is it?
It's something for executives.
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and
Just open the door, please.
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
Eliminate the competition.
You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
My troops don't make policy.
Well, they die for it!
Yeah.
He'd want to know about all this.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
Yes.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
No thanks.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
Thank you.
That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?
I'm in the vending room.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
Does that mean suck my dick?
I'm Doctor Marcus!
Russian.
It's Elvis...
Who?
It's me...
Marcel?
My father left me the business.
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
What's at the end of it?
Can't wait.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Never better.
Really?
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
Nautilus?
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
285.
Oh.
Like fish.
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
Miss.
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
I'll watch my back.
Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
That's right.
And what did your team do...
Well, we...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
Yes.
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...We did everything we could...
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
Yes!
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
Tell us.
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
Don't interpret that!  Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!!  Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
I call this the staccato. 
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
Oh yeah?
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Refresh my memory.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Maybe I blocked it out.
I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
You were never a kid.
It's better, Mary Sue.
I said, NO!  ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ...
No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
And if I say yes?
Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Not yet.
Who's the other one?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
What's her story?
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
And splittin' with her?
I'm sure that was the idea.
What did you say?
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
She told you that?
Uh-huh.
Was she there?
She didn't say.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Uh-huh.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
What are you saying?
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
I want brain parasites.
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
I want that.
You can't have the whole brain!
So far, you have four and I only have two!
Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
Who are you?
Tseirp a si eh! Eno on ma I! Eno on ma I! Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
Why, I needed a
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Fifteen years?
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
I don't understand.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Yeah.  You pull the strings --  "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good!
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
How?
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
It's not me, it's my wife.
What is?
I told you.
Tell me again.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
Yes, James.
Even if I end up going to jail....
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
Good.
Uh-huh.
What's she doing now?
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Copy.
We've got a -
There's the car! There's the car!
Do you have a lover now?
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
What?
That's not why we're here.
What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got --  Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
Who tied her down?  You or him?
He had a gun.  He had a gun... and he made it happen.  He made me do it!  He made me put that... that thing on.  Oh, Christ!  He made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her.  He had the gun in my mouth.
Tonight?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Come on. You can rave on another night.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Tumble it.  One end to the other.
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Well that's something.
What is.
You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
I'm not even listening.
You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
I didn't even see them fire!
Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
Yeah.
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
I'm making a mess.
This I can see.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
David, you're drunk.
Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
What?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
She's dead.
You okay?
Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Why not?
No, I'm good, Angelo.
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
Guessing at this point is useless.
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
I'll be on board by noon.
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
I don't think so, Jim...
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
I say you should get a shrink.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
How often do you go?
I don't go at all.
Good night, Josephine.
Transitioned?
You crossed over.
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
Somewhere in Italy.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
That operation has begun.  Are we God, that we would <u>Meddle</u> with it...?  <u>No</u>, on the <u>other</u> hand...
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
Gasparilla?
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.
It's not about working hard --
Bullshit.
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
What?!
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
Maura.
Maura.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
You had a nasty bump.
Yeah.
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
That's the ticket, laddie.
... But it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix...!
Youre a little tougher, Peter.
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
Okay.
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
I want my pills NOW!
It'll only take a second.
I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...
I'd have to see it on.
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Me?  Why me?
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
That was Nancy, not me!
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Pretend we're just another couple.
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
Like...?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
No.
Good.  So let's go...
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Bombers.
I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Yeah...?
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
Ok
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
What's that?
Powerful warrior.
Yeah.  Dinky-dau, that's me.  Hey, Co.  You wanna meet Jake the one- eyed snake?
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
I guess you did.
Guess I just got sick of him.
Can I walk you home?
I think I could do that alone.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Yeah.
You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
He thought so, yes.
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Well...yeah--
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Well yeah...I know that.
So Dieter has the money?
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Huh?  No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--
Richard, I had to see you.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Please.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
No. I'll do them later.
Francesca?
What?
Are you all right?
Yes.
Francesca?
What?
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
Elroy.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!
Danny!
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
Oh I like her a lot.
I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
Isn't that interesting?
Central Services.
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Mr. Sim, watch out!  O'Brien escaped and could be on his way!
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
Yeah.
I don't think so either.
They'll never stop.
I love you.
They ruined me tonight.
Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
We've missed you too, dear.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It's a good script, isn't it?
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
All right. 
I'll be damned...
Susan Lefferts.
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
Follow me.
How come everyone thinks hitting me's the best way to get my attention?
We miss you. We miss our son.
We miss our family.
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
What happened? How far did you get?
Shut up. Let him eat. Don't pay them no mind, boy.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
She's only known the guy a few months.
We tried.
The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em out yourself.  It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
Going grows slower... we've not made... half a mile in two hours...
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Then what good is he?
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
Is that a problem?
Not for you, clearly.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Am I a thing?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
I'm not.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a knock.
It's not a compliment.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
As soon as you get dressed.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
Why?
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
Like you.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Oh, god.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
I'm scared!
Yes sir.
Well, I guess we better hit the road.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
I...
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Honey ...
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
Frank.
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
Who hired the bastard?
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
Like what?
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
What is it?
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
And you can?  Power it up?
Nope.  Never. 
... Alright.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
I'll match any man with the sword.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
It must have been some other gate.
No, thanks.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
You picked her up on the ferry.
I didn't know her.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
Think she might've run out on you?
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
You from around here?
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
You here for the summer?
Some friends and me took a house.
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
Pretty stiff.
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
Then don't.
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
My nails.
People still watch that?
Who cares about people?
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
Who said I wanted to buy it?
He's after us again!
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit.  How 'bout him down there?
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
Things? What kind of things?
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?!  Did it?!  For one thing she's always thirty minutes late.  You can set your watch by it--
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
What's that, sir?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Ah... pity, pity...
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
Yes sir. Negative effect.
What was that, Doolittle?
Negative effect.
It didn't work?
That's correct, sir.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Well, what you might try is --
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
I know what you mean.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
Bet.
Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
Only that floor.
Is the hostage injured?
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
That's right!
Where did it come from, Mama?
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
Where was it parked?
Right here.
...it's definitely on.
Beautiful.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
And what did they say?
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
I brought you something.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
Hit the fuckers.
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
I need a new PR guy.
I love you too.
Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
We just talked.
Sure.
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
Let's go. Eject.
Sure.
No, I'm not...
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
I don't know...
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
When's your next round?
Thursday.
Oh...
We went out there, full SWAT, two choppers, the whole bit, but Linares started shooting anyway.  We put him down, but somehow Chirino got away.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
I just wish it was that simple.
Just behind us, over to the right.
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
Abrams...
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
I'm fine.
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
Yes.
Ah.  How did they treat you?
Yes.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
No.
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
...Yeah.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
I might not be able to.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Of course, but not now.  However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me.
Ninety-five miles an hour...
Good.
Good.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
You're a thousand percent right!
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
You know it, Lilly.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
I will. So long, Bobo.
Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
Stop it, Wladek.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
You're the one who started running.
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
Are you so certain you are away from it?
As far away as I ever want to be.
Oh, dear.
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
No!
And charming?
I've never given it much thought.
Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
Who are you guys?
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
You are talking crazy!
You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
Why are you on to him?
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Why'd you invite me here?
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
What about the others.
I don't know.
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
A big one....
A big one....
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
How long will the effect last?
About ten minutes.
Ten minutes...
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
Okay, I guess.
How about dinner tonight?
Mom and I got plans.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
She's taking singing lessons.
She's what?
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
Ssh!
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
You're such a baby.
All right, here.
I like to laugh, Fred.
That's why I married you.
Wake me up when you get home.
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
And where is the army?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
And who is defending Paris?
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Blacks welcome there?
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
I don't know.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
Sun spot?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
Absolutely not.  Probably one or two hours.  Four at the most.
Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
Sarcastic right?  You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I only did it once and...
Is there a killer loose?
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
Ours.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
And look at this, Doctor!
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
No.
What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
What?
Did you?
Did I what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Hey, I don't tell.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Yeah?
Well, did you or didn't you?
Maintenance.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Very good, Sir.
Excuse me?
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
You told me you'd say that.
Abort the plan.
You told me you'd say that, too.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
Well, sir, you said you might.
Hello?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
I know.  Thank her for me.
It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny.
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
Three bullets! Any good?
Beats king up.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right.  They're here now ... Right ... Let me know.
To collect my fee.
I'm going to California.
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
No.
No.
Hang on.
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
We'll see in the morning...
Don't bet on it!
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you?  Well, you don't know shit, buddy.
You have fed. You were made for this...
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Terry Valentine.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Anyone else?
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't.
Don't push me away.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Don't do this.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
Don't do this!
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
You changed your mind.
I wanted you back.
I understand. Thanks anyway.
I'm thinking.
So think already.
Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
Set!
Now!
Compute!
Of course. Have you got a pen?
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Sure I do.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Watch out for that glass.
Not long.
Daddy you scared me!
You're grounded Friday night!
What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
It's not that... it's not that...
What do you mean?
It's not my time of month.
Should you see a doctor?
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
For what?
I don't know... I don't know...
That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
Yeah.
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Own the desert.
No.
Why?
'Cause it stinks.
What was the Donner party?
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
All right. Let me out.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
You mother...
I have to go.
Then take me with you.
No. Youll be safe here.
I dont want to be safe!
I have to go to work.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
You say that because you have the title!
No!  I would never cheat you.
Well that's very nice of you.
Said he'd be home later.
Later when?
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
I... suppose so, yes.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
That's more like it.
There is something I want.  A friend.
Friend?
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
And if I consent?
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
How am I supposed to transport them?
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
How?
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I
Go on a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
Thanks, Johnny... .
Well, now--
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
"Titanic."
Excuse me...!
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Show me again...
Okay... 
Oui.
Take what you've got and get out of there.
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
I'm her father.
Ilsa... you're alright?
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Or two.
You're going too?
I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.
Aye, aye, sir.
May I use the phone please.
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
That's not the point.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
I'm not picking it up.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
Yes. It is today.
He's right, Les.
Long.
Very high an' very fast.
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
And you broke into that room?
That's right.
You will wish you hadn't.
Fuck you!
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
Yeah, what happened?
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
You think so?
Trust me.
No you don't.
Yes - and I'd love it.
What's wrong?
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart.
Are you happy?
Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
Please don't go.
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
Would you excuse us, please.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
What are you doing here?
We have to talk.
Your painful groin?
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
Yeah?
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
Listen, we get a deluge like this, just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough. So never mind the side issues.
My place.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
You've not been to school all week, son.
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Splendid! Is he sick?
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.
What's that book you've got there?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
I think I love you, Alex --
The view had better be worth it.
Yeah. Let's do that.
Really?
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
Rams... that's football, right?
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
Call them.
He isn't here.
Why?
Because they're playing our song.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
So how's the job going?
No.
What?
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Look, I didn't shoot him!
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
Didn't they tell you?
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Shhh!
Go to bed.
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
They're not my children.
Whata you mean?  He told me -
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
Thanks.
Yeah. All week long.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
I have AIDS.
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Vernon T. Waldrip.
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
What business?
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Well...no, of course not--
I want a child.
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
Huh...
He's running the show.
I'm running the show. I make the plays, and you back the plays I make. Stop thinking with your fucking balls. Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to "go for it." I need your cover. Cover my ass.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Yeah.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
You want me to just hang-- ?
Just hang a minute.
I'll just hang then, shall I?
But why?
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
Call an ambulance.
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Fine--
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Certainly would, Joseph.
How's Amos, Ma?
Just fine.
We'd better see.
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Good.
We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
It's a...full length life-size figure!
What's it called?
Murdered man.
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Seriously.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Really?
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
You need a nickname.
That's what I been telling everybody!  Wanta dance?
My head hurts.
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Doggy.
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Montana.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Pillow.
Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'
All paved with diamonds and gold?
You know me better than that.
Paved with what, then?
Stars.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
Really...
Have a seat.
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Yes, thanks.
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
Ah ...
What?
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
Layton! Oh shit!
What is it?
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Am I?
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
How do you mean?
How much do you know?
Not much.
Enough though, eh?
Not really, no.
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Helena --
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
Run the subscription list...
That's right.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
What about you?
I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
Thanks.
Call me later, hon.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
Life is just a state of mind.
But it's my favorite state.
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
Your father was a sick weirdo.
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
This??
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
So I've noticed.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
Even that would be an improvement.
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
What are you doing here?
Screaming
Besides that.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
I'd better get you down.
Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Thank you.
I think so.
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
Jobs doing what?
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
What don't I understand?
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Got it.
. Yeah!
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Why, what's gonna happen?
It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
It feels so.. .real.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
This is supposed to be years away.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
How do you kill it?
Separate the character module from the neural net...
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
Whos the guy? Whos the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him.
Here comes Daddy.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
And I have mine.
Yes.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Yes - isn't it?
Get out --
Men of all races -- nationalities --
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
What about a radio?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
What the hell would you call this?
I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
I got my wish anyway.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
But it's already come true.
Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
Do you want us to come with you?
I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
Curious...  Very curious.
I see your point. What's the favor?
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
Dream on, blue eye.
Say goodnight, Carjack.
I've heard you call him Freddy.
You <u>haven't</u>. And you got no voice in here, Taylor, <u>so keep it shut</u>.
Yeah, thanks for everything.
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
Yeah, yeah...
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
What's that -- what's that?
I think so.
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
...they come!
And Brynner's right on...
...our ass!
He's comin' up fast!
Great.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
Yeah... I mean great.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Too bad for her if she's not around.
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
Women are always late.  You'll find out.
Yes, I know.
I dove 315 feet!
Great!
They say I'm like Lazarus.  You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
How to kiss ass.
He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Hello, Hildy!
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
I don't know.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
What?
War.
War?
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Who is "they?"
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Who is they, who is they?
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
He has a wife?!
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
God, that's awful!
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
No, I won't...
I can't see.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
Who are you?
It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
What?
You're already there...
The doctor said you were having sex.
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Oh my god! On TV!
Why? How...
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
But Al is your husband now!
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
Yes I know.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
No.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
I didn't mean -
Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.
Take him.
Have you got one or haven't you?
Not ... as such ...
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
Safety?
Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
You know what I just watched?
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Return of the Jedi.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Empire.
Blasphemy.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
Bad?
The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
We're going down.  All of us....
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
I do, too!
All right, what do you know?
Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
Because, don't get into it ...
There's nothing in the files?
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
Here, carry these.
Sir, my leg is on fire!
What for?
Because there's a man I want to see.
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
I'm fine..
What the fuck is going on?
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
What?
Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
I should be better by now.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
But it ends up the same.
One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
I have a question for you.
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
Why do people go to war?
I'll play your silly game.
Why do they go to War?
To preserve their Way of Life.
Would you go to War to do that? 
I have.
Well, I have, too.  Would you do it <u>again</u>...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess <u>so</u>.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and <u>Togo</u>? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>over</u>.  The War of the Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  You have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, <u>this</u>  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours. 
My butt's bothering me!
You should kick your butt's ass. Huh huh huh.
It's amazing.
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Can I ask you a question?
Depends on the question.
Are you still in love with Alan?
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Why'd you let me in?
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
Good point.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
What about his parents?
He never sees them and I never met them.
How come?
Now that's cool.
Cool?
Yeah, cool.
You think it's cool?
It's cool!
It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!
Why?
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
You couldn't have made that jump.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
He could have died.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Y-yes--
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Times up!
What?
Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
God of passages and changes?
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
I've read of it.
But have never been?
My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books.  But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.
Yeah.
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
That's a good one.
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
They've started the battle without me!
Police?
Huh?
You called the police?
Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend.  An old, ornery friend.
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Yes, quite.
We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
Bobby.
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
Being faxed over now.
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Roper...
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
Roper, we're into it...
Thanks. Hope you do too.
By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.
Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
Success!! Our device works perfectly! We will begin mass production immediately!
Huh?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
So what's the time?
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
--Howard Hunt?
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
Any idea what he did?
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
--Teddy Kennedy?
Sure. I remember seeing a book about Chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the White House Library and the Library of Congress and--
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Again, I thank you.
I was talking about Miles.
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
What call?
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Where?
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Yes am.
Pretty close?
Pretty close.
Did he tell you about my party?
Sure did.
About my daughter?
No I didn't know you had one.
He didn't mention?
No.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
He didn't mention her.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
That depends.
On what?
The priest.
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
You wouldn't.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I beg your pardon?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
I didn't get you?
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Oh yeah, since when?
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Rocky, I'm seventy-six years old. Maybe you can be the winner I never was -- your shot is my last shot!
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Coffee?
No. I'm okay.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
No, I'm okay.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
You're kidding.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Three years.
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
I presume it's a sword.
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Your murder weapon?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
A mystery.
For the moment.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
Like what?
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
You forgot something...
Are we leaving?
Yes you are.
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
Why?
Because that's where the fire is?
When will Strader return?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
Im fine standing, thank you.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Right.
Aren't you?
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
What?
Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.
Nothing.
What's going on ?
Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
...Why don't I just type this up...
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...
Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
It's a beautiful thing.
A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."
Forget it.
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
What?
Whatever it is she does for you.
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
But not for long...
It's the truth.
Sir--
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Sir, you can't just--
DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.
Right.
Well...
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
I don't have another cat!
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
A parakeet?
I'm fine.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
...my files! Personal correspondence...
Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
As you wish.
Nathan!
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
I like it, Nick.
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
How much?
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Of course not. Please.
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
Five hundred.
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
All right.
...Six months.
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What kind of things?
You know, us.
I thought you met someone else.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
Really?
I miss you, Mike.
Why didn't you call?
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
...the Michelin commercial...
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens...
Hiya, Jesus.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Whatta you got?
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
What's playing there?
Your entire body?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
I have to think! I have to think!
What do you want me to say?
Just be natural, goddamit.
How long since your last confession, my son?
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
Why?  You interested?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
Leadership....
We're partners, aren't we?
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.
Los Angeles.
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Where'm I going?
I certainly did, sir...
You certainly do.
So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
Implicitly.
Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
When?
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
You must have been dreaming.
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
Jesus.
Otho, can you do it?
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
No cars.  Feet are faster.
How many more do we have after this?
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
They still seem nervous.
I know.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you.  Is that it?
What about you?
I'll look around and catch up later.
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
And you believed that story.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
I've always taken care of you.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
It's the way Pop wanted it.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand?
I thought he was with you.
Crazy motherfucker.
I know.  Every time!
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
AND HE'S GUNNING.
Sure but what good will that do?
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
You lost your head.
I was just showing emotion.
They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
Hello...this is Long Distance.  I have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr. Michael Corleone.  One moment please.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Save my son, d'Artagnan.
Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Why?
Because you are dangerous.
Why?
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
I do not understand.
I know.
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...
No.  Absolutely not.
All right.  All right.  We'll see.
I want him here.  Sit down!
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
What's your plan of attack?
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
But who will they turn to for help?
What else you got?
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Okay, okay -- stand over there....
What is it?
Like this. 
I'll get my bag.
Then whose is it?
You gotta just look the other way.
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'm not going!
I'll get your bag.
You made this, and the drawings?
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
Give me a chance --
That's sick, Dante.
It's okay..it's okay.
But it's July.
It's still the new year...
What about your job?
I have vacation time coming to me.
You don't have a passport.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Is that Buckethead?
Lamar --
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
You'll never make it.
Have to.
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Me! Jim--how--?
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
Y-yes, Jim.
I doubt it! Come on, Ken.
Pretty well.
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Yes.
Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?
Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
Why?
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
Them?
Yes.
You're doing just fine.
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
To get my guns.
Hello.
I won't introduce you all by name. Basically James, this is our UK sales team.  What was I saying? Yes, these graduate trainees...
What kind of trouble?
Well, sir, about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders, General Jack D. Ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirty-four B-90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing, under his command.
Shhhhhh.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Father's so proud.
And you?
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
I'll have to do better than that.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
Yes, I'm glad.
He's damn good.
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
Thank you.  And always smile.
And maybe a little something else?
A little something what?
I am.
Talk to us about it...
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
Good as new! It's quite all right--
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
You ain't to hurt them fellas.
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
The money!
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Uhura, you did what was necessary.  Keep trying. You'll find him...
I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
I just said--
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
I never paid for it in my life.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
OK. increase the peace.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
Thank you...
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Sir...?
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
I don't understand.
Twelve.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
How's the arm?
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
He's moved on to TV.
He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job, even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
What's her problem?
She has no real grip on reality.
Does anybody?
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
And what does Jennifer think's real?
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Transporter room. Status.
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Maybe they already have.
Typical male.
Typical male.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
Hello!  Good morning.
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Which stall?
Excuse me?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
I don't want to go back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
I don't care to bargain.
That insults them.
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
Excuse me.
...Hi.
...You any good with those?
Possibly.
Maybe I should drive this time.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
Suit yourself.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
German.
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
Please say it.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
OK. 
You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
If you came back.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
Something like that.
And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.
Have we had trouble there before?
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
I don't know. I kind of am.
Yes.
How do we get out of here?
We have to make it to the third deck...
I guess we won't.
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
Son, let's watch the tape.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
Morpheus believes he is the One.
There'll be a time.
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Did you see him?
Who?
The guy. He just came this way.
What guy?
There's somebody else on this boat.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
You sure it wasn't me?
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
This is my room.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Can I confess something?
No.
You're sure?
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
But what does your intuition tell you...?
I'll act surprised.
We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
You crazy?
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
I got to fetch her home...
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Only if I'm dead!
Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
But, Comrades...
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
One last push. One.
Something like that.
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
Then, you'll die...  Just, know this:  because you asked I asked:  I'm sorry but...
"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
We've got some things to discuss.
<i>I forgot.</i>
For the love of God. Not Spanish again. Who's the girl?
Thanks. I made them by hand.
No. No...
You fucking swear to shut up!
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
In a manner of speaking.
We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
I do.
Don't you want to change that?
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Same time next week?
No. This is going to be our last session.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
Beth.
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
It wasn't easy.
When?
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
A criminal?
Did you not enter this country illegally?
Yes, I do.
What do you do?
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
And whatever you sensed out here....
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
You might still have a house.
I wish it could all have been different.
Look after yourself, Grace.
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk?  About what?
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
About what you said this morning.
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
Sure, I'll take a chance.
If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
Millionaires, man.
No. Josie, this is real.
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
What one?
Behold!
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
They're coughing.
They're gonna die in there!
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
-- go blind.  I know.
I won't be late.
Did something happen today?
Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
And where will you sleep beautifully?
Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers-  -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible. 
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
What about money?
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
That's swell!
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
He called you "MacLeod".
Not your concern.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
That bothers you?
He was innocent.
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
What about me?
You?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
Have you gone to the police?
No.
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
I'd rather hear yours.
You are being foolish.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
Go home.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crpes caviar.
Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!
I saw it.
Nikki.
Thank you, Nikki.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
You said it, Jon, not me.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
...gotta read my reports.
Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there.
I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
There is no problem.
So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
I wasn't hungry.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
Paul.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
I know your parents.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Or teach it a better tune.
Then you remember more than I do.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Get car.  Get car.
Very nice girl.
You know this earth - this person.
I most certainly do.  He happens to be an old friend of mine.
Check it out.
To my weekly confession.
We have a business manager. The best around.
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
Not yet.
How's TransOcean doing?
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
No.
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
What?
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
Yes . . .
I know what to do about mother.
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Don? Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Yes.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
No. I should go.
Please, please stay.
What? Why? What do you mean?
He is.
Then when is he going to Engineering?
I think that's what I'm saying.
What?
Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
Shut up.
Rae...
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
Rae don't do this now...
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
Rae!
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
Show me.
I will -- I promise.
I'm sorry.
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
Sam, don't --
What?
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
We did not approach you.
Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Some.
Used to be my partner.
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
Relax, you'll live longer.
The name is Smythe.
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up.
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
I just got here.  Talk to you later...
Why?
What Bert's trying to say iswellwe need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
I came from the city on the left.
But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Screw you!
You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
Out of the room.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
I don't believe it.  Do you?
For Munro children?
Yes.
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
The King? The King has mountains of gold!
What is it?
A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
Honey, come here.
And a missing man.
Hi, guys.
It's a whale out there.
Who is this guy, anyway?
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
Okay...
It's okay, my sweet.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
No.
Bring it on, dude.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Me! No. Of course not.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
No. 
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Because they're still here.
Oh.
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
What is that?
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors.  Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries.
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
Okay!
Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
Don't talk to me like that.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
Be my guest.
That's disgusting.
Yeah. But I --
Sorry.
No, it's all right.
What are you doing?
Midnight watch.
They would have killed this man?
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
How long will that take?
They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital.  Take him over to G2.
Point taken.
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
I'm already hurting.
Give me a break, Grady.
Why did you wait?
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
It will not end tonight.
You cannot hide from me.  You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want.  Do you know what that means? I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want.  The world will be mine.
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - a gizzard - -
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
- - barfs them up - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
What?
My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
So let the council swear publicly.
We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
How many?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
Okay.  How many going out?
I hear six.
When?
Looks like tonight.
You know who they are?
I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on 3rd.
No.  You're right.
Show Must Go On.
A proud tradition.
Prouder of this, than anything I ever did in my life. I want to thank you, Ron.  Want to thank you.
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Who's this?
Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
You see? Thea believes it, too!
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Mississippi?
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
And make sure he doesn't leave.
What?
Make sure he doesn't leave.
The Prince ... ?
Yes ...  make sure ...
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Is that clear?
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
Where ya headed?
What?
It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...
Who? Who is?
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
I know! I fuckin' know!
You don't!
I do!!!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
She does not!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
She does, Vince! That's what I'm telling you! She does!!!
Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
Good evening, sir.
Who told you I was married?
There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
No?
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
That's right.
Oh, now--that won't do--
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
You're the best nurse I can think of--
Nice *compliment*!
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
No?
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
Yeah?  And what else?
What do you mean?
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
I...
You got to get out of here...
I got your number, Mister Man.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
A card?
Yes, sir.
Of course!
Absolutely not.
Toss you for it.
I don't gamble.
You look beautiful.
Really?
Truly.
Through the sweats or not?
Not.
They belong to the people.
I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
So much the better.
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
You can always come see it in London.
Only if you were in it. Are you?
I wouldn't miss it.
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Are you an actor?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Are you really serious? About acting?
Why... yes.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Why?
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
You sound as if you hate it.
No, I don't hate it.
Good coffee, isn't it?
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
PMS.
That's not our intent --
-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --
What the hell you talking about?
"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked.
...Let's see the pigs, please.
It's brought people back to the church.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
So - why the airport?
I work in the immigration department there.
No. 
Let's go.
C'mon -- what?
You're lying --
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
But --
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
That's when you went in the sphere.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
You manifested that, Beth.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
You're insane.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
I never went in that sphere.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
Yes.
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
That's bullshit.
Is it?
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
Shut up, Beth --
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Here.
I'm not hungry.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Really?
Well--it was dark out ...
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
It was accessible to everyone.
Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
Kindred spirits.
No, he's nothing like me.  He's like you.  Only straight.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
You punched the President in the face?
He wasn't the President then.
Of course.
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
'A Moray eel....'
'Snuck up on me....'
'It got us in hot water...We should have been there for Carla....'
... an offlander?
For someone so young.
Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
But I didn't get you one...
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
Yes.
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.
Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
But they don't have a case against you.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Don't make no difference no more.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
What friends?
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
No.  Not even you.
Why so glum?
I don't know.
Go ahead.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
I don't believe it.
I'm afraid it's true.
I want to see.
No you don't.
Yes!
Show her.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
Your parents'd kill you.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Yah?
Oh-you-beccha.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
We do not know.
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
You the bug lady, right?
Shortie, look!
What's wrong?
They go.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
They go.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
We reinvented ourselves.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Where was that?
Walker and Williams.
What did you say your name is?
Anderson.
What?
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
That woulda been cool.
Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, this has everything to do with you.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem.  Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay.  You're fucked now, pal!  Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay.  Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
You bring trunks, Jack?
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
Shall we?
Just what I said I'd do.
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Chris -- Chris -- !
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
How's that?
Have you made up your mind?
About what?
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
I don't think so...
Why not?
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
There's always exceptions.
Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.
Your Honor!
Oh --
What's wrong?
Well, I need to study, and...
You need to study?
Yeah.
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
We'll see.
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
Yeah, uh-huh.
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
Come where?
My office.
For how long?
Well, that depends...
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
What?!?!
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
Trick him.
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
You should think about getting professional help.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
Don't worry about it.
Alright, so I'll get more.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
But you had!
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
I think so too.
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
Yes!
No visa.
I must get into that country of yours!
Oh no. No visa.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
You're going to force us... huh?
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Why should I take a chance?
On what?
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
What for... why?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country....
Home.
Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
You make any sandwiches?
My first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly I could never even swallow till recess--
Is that like a party trick?
All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
It's been a long time.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Pleased to meet you.
Sightseeing.
The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
Yes.  I hear you.
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
Mmm.
Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Yea, how much?
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Let's just leave.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Let's go.
Who's the big winner?
Next channel, darling.
I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. 
It might be in the kitchen.
Six seconds.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
I'd like you to leave now.
They're not gone, they're here.
They're mine!
The hospital? 
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
Maybe.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
Back in the driver's seat again, Doctor?  That old dream -- study us to see what makes us sick.  So you can find a cure -- they'd name it after you?  Death is the only cure for people like me.
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
Let's not get excited, sir.
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
I was just tryin' to...to...
Tell it to Max.  Tell him he's an asshole.
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
What?
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
Try again.
I think I recognize you.
How?
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening
Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You know
Probably.
I don't trust her.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
Adelle?
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? Theyre all panicked here...
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
Just get out of your vehicle...
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
Don't you start it, too!
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
You sure about this?
I'd stake my reputation.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
Did you report it stolen?
They went that way.
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
Right, Mack!
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
All right, then.
Oh, hey...
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
I don't know what to...
Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
Oh yeah.
I can't move any smaller.
Try again between the static and 'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding.
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
All of it?
Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
Johnny...
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Good.
Have you come to make peace with me?
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Of course I want to.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
But he sure can kiss.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
How do you do?
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Well then who did?!
Maybe it was Colleen...
Who...is Colleen?
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
Everybody.  Get behind me.
I hurt my finger.
Get a typist.  Gettim a typist.  Get outta here.
Not as far as the election goes.
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
You really love this guy...?
He's got great hands.
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
I like him.  He can stay.
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
Good.
Yeah?
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Huh huh.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
True.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
Don't move! I'll get him back!
Calm down, Bud.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
No?
No. You like the way I do things.
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
Right.
How about New York?
What am I looking at?
I didn't do that.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Dressed?
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
When?
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
Oh.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
Tonight?
Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Do you?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
Right.
Looks like the fishing was good.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
I'm not mushing it.
You're mushing it a little around the--
<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear. Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down for the count, and you and Eileen life happily ever after. Now, hit me in the stomach.
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
I need Il Duce.
The Duke?  What did you do?
This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
Just tell us what you can --
It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Right.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
With, like, images?
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
I don't want to go there.
Do it my way.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Yes or no will do.
Oh. Well, yes.
How many languages do you speak?
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
Disintegrated?
What? Nobody set anybody up.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Bullshit.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
I don't know, but somebody did.
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
Until the old man tells me different.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
Will you?
Gee, thanks friend.
Hey, that was last year.
Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
Yes? Galvin, right?
Loser? You?
Well we don't.
I can't frisk you but the cops can.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
I'm choking on it.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
What you got in there, warshing?
Yeah.
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
About a half a mile I think it is.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
Okay. You don't have to though.
What are they...?
They're called Novril--they're for your pain. 
They suspended me for 100 years.
100 years! 
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
What do you think I can do?
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
I believe you're right, boss.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
Sir?
The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
Don't they believe in signs here?
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
I didn't see it.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
Tell me one thing.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
Still don't see it--
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
You'll see for yourself.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
I'm all right.
It's fucking freezing out here.
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
Kevlar Second Chance.
I hope you have a second chance...
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
You got it.
Let's walk the route.
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
So I did! And what was so important about it?
Scotland. He intends --
ABC.
How much?
Minimum.
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
Will you lead me to her?
Aye.  On the morrow we go, but tonight...  ... tonight is for making merry.
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
John! I'm so glad to see you. II was terribly worried.
I get it. You can drop it now.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Ha! Where's that?
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
Yes?
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Excuse me?
You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.
A woman eh? I see.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
This is your dream girl, is it?
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
Well don't you think that's odd?
What?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
Oh my gosh...
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
And some man will lose his.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
He and his wife splitting up?
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Isn't he a salesman?
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
Hey...hey!
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
...Sure.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
Absolutely...
Do you have cause to bothering us?
There's no point both of us getting wet.
I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
Yes.
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
Okay.
No. I'm glad I'm home.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
1922. Why the kippers?
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
Whereas you are.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
And just what is the game?
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
Much better.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
I didn't. Mother did.
Mother?
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
I'd love that.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Feel free.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
You.
Me.
Come on. Let's go.
please, what is it, please --
just let me walk out, ok?
Mrs. Christian.
What?
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
Tom... she's dead.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
Four fernet.
You really don't remember?
No... I told you.
It was weird...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
I don't want to talk about it...
Sheila?!
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Somewhere downtown.
I'm sorry.
This is embarrassing.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
I'll take care of it.
NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
No?
Red, and I ain't no punk.
You better not be. Cause if a cat toe you down in this town, you better stand up or make tracks.
It's time to go home, Holly.
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
Yes...How's Billy?
Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
That wasn't my fault.
Save it.  Just go.
The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Let's hear it.
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
How'd you happen to miss?
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Good thing you didn't.
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
Day or night?
Good evening.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Oh, that's so interesting!
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
I'm sure he's matured since then.
That's awful.
What the hell.  Did your mom put all this together?
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
What about his brother?
We'll handle that. He's careless.
I don't know who we are anymore.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Yes, sir.
You get what?
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem?
I do.
What it smell like?
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
King of the WHO?
The Britons.
Who are the Britons?
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
Ain't had time to check 'em.
Where are you gonna go?
I'm gonna go now.
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
What are you getting at!
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
You found us in the Penny Saver?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
Take our literature...
Uh-huh.
...read it over, and think about it.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
playfully shoves his hand away.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
Are you feeling all right?
He never told me...
You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on.
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
Cool, huh huh.
Home free.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Of course.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
I just want her to be happy.
Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
No, not yet.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Everything is quite all right.
Oh, Rick!
Why?
You can't take that.
Why not?
The experiment. The danger...
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
What's wrong?
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
Make up your mind, trigger.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
I sure hope so.
Then it's a deal.
Jesus...
The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam. Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign customs... and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. They hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
That's my girl.
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
Something like that.
Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
You got it.
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Are you getting tired?
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
THIS much.
Sounds delightful.
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
You were given backup....
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
No, I don't get you...
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
Everything's okay? 
But, Eve, I would--
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
A tracer. You'll like it.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
I'm Joel.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound?
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
I'm not nuts.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Well, anyway... Sorry.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
Mr. Bangs.
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Yeah.
She's not with you?
Who.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
Who?
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Who, Ray?
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
Serve.
I was trying to educate you.
Just serve.
In the same fashion as chess.
What?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
Will you shut up and play.
You're a bad loser.
I haven't lost yet.
Uhura!... Where!
Mercy Hospital.
Don't panic.
Don't talk to me!!
Thanks for the speakers.
That doesn't make any sense.
I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
Yes.
May I ask Why?
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
What're you doing here anyway?
Coffee and a donut.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
It's dark.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi.
Some kind of mutation...?
That's right, Steve.
Can I have my gun back?
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
What time is it?
It's about eleven thirty.
Yes!!!
You've heard Beethoven before?
Yes!!!
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend.
Come on.
God be with us admiral.
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
Okay, that's IT!!!
Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
Hi there!  You alright?
We're fine!  How are you?
Grrrreat!
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
I am busy inside.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.
Nah... scotch.
Far out. Single malt?  Can I pick it?
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
Okay. Okay, look my wife called the police. They're coming. It's not too late. They'll come, they'll take care of her. I'm going inside.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
No, he's ruining yours.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
You have a real philosophy of life.
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
Not as long as I'm alive.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
What do you meanstarvation?
It takes money to buy food.
Why, haven't you?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
To New York?
Yeah.
I'm following you.
Aren't you afraid of me?
No.
Okay. Hang on to these.
You broke it? You know the source?
Practically.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
What's the age of consent in this country?
Night.
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
-- Sacha, call a cab.
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
Heard that.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
Sure.
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
Good evening, Captain.
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
It'll spoil our supper.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
What?
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
What are you talking about?
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.
I'm scared.  What is it?
It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of...
What does that mean?
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
You got that right.
...one more day.
Naw, naw, we own the airways... 
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
I think you're looking at him.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe online, yet?
I love you...
What an honor...
Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
How much we got left in that minigun?
Yes.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Got dag pa dig.
Yes. We lost five.
You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
Let's get you darker!
You're out of your mind!
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
They can use their imaginations.
Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
How do you think I'm doing?
I don't know what happened.
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
To hear them read Torah.
I thought you hated Torah.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -
I'm sorry.  I, we
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
What's she saying?
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
So I followed him...
You followed him?
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
You keep a bat under your seat?
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
Yes, great movie...
I was DeNiro!
Seamus Reilly.
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
People without cars.
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
What happened?
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
We're talking, aren't we?
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
No, not yet.
Yeah. Scary stuff.
No.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Tom is right.
Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
None taken.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
The Academy, then CIIAC.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
How long have you been downtown?
Five months. I love it.
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
A world of pain.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I can't.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
Up.
What?  Up?
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
Who's gonna win?
We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
She ate.
There's something else, Major...
Mmmnnn...?
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
Anna's the witch.
I won't keep you another minute...
Who?
The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.
How do you know?
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
Everyone regrets something.
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Sometimes.
Do you think about their wives or their families?
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
Define small.
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Proper?!
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
What party?
The birthday party.
Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty.  She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.
What are you doing here?
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Yes I did.  Excuse me.
What happened to him?
He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Make time?  Is everybody in this town slap happy?
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Good.  Let's get dry.
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
You're sure...
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Sure. Why?
You're acting kind of...odd.
<i></i> In what way?
Last year, this was a new rig.
But it wasn't a Kenworth.
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
Let me get my bag.
Get back to your positions!
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
We should go.
Why this tree?
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
For what purpose?
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
Terry's name should be on this wall.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
So damn stupid.
You're done worse.
I'll be scarred for life.
No you won't.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
Seventy a year.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
Sixty.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
What was your deal with Job?
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?
That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
You're lookin' green.
Why? What I say bad?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
What? Why am I bad?
Oh, I'll say.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
Why did you call me?
Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...
No thanks.
Mary Clarence!
She say she in great pain.
Thanks for the translation.  What's your name? Nombre?
Today, a good girl.
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
It's all right with me. Is he here?
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
Yeah. He said that.
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews.
What?
What, Doctor?
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Everything?
I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
Nah, I don't know.
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
Yes, Dad.
You understand?
Not even her?
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
I'm already free...
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
They did?
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
Wow.  Why would they do that?
Cause of the chromium.
The what?
The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.
How?
Long story.  His goons will be here any minute.  We've got to get you out of here '- now!
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
I'd like to read it some time.
Martha Louise Livingston.
Are you married?
No.
Would you like to be?
Not at the moment, no.
Do you have any children?
No.
Would you like some?
I can't have them any more.
Why not?
I've stopped menstruating
Why do you smoke?
Does it bother you?
No questions.
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
One.
What?
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty...
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
Got it.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
The waste.
But I wasn't.
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
I can't say that.
Think about your father. Your sister.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
Fucking kike.
Lawford?
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
Homicide?  A detective?
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
Take care of me?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Want me to come back some other time?
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
It'll be okay.
He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
Relax, let technology do the work.
You <u>were</u>?
Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now.  "I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
You don't.  It's a gamble.  But, not even in Vegas are you gonna get close to this kind of cash.  This is <U>two million</U>, Archie.  It's not three houses, it's twelve.  It's dreams come true.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
I know.  I know what you mean.  I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
Just like on TV.
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?

I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
You're a wimp.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Then your father's a wimp.
And you're just poor white trash!
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
It's been known to happen.
Not to me, you know that.
I thought I did.
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
Ssssh!
Good God, you're really-
Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
Yeah.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
I can't leave him!
Au revoir.
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Deal.
Phasers locked...
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
You're being paranoid.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
To death?
Yes, that's right.
The woman question?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
Not that one.
NOT THAT ONE?!
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
--there's thousands of 'em!
A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
-- he's doing it then, huh --
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
-- okay, g'head --
So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a "specialist" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap -- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing.
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
They are?
Yes  charge.
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Aw, get going!
Yes, sir.
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
Maybe he doesn't know...
There's been a slight problem.
What's that?
And what would you do?
Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
Go ahead, Jam.
We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Yes, air.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
No!
Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time.
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
Maybe.
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
Not with you.
...Is he brown?
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
I was tried for murdering my husband.  Guilty.  The judge set the verdict aside.  There was one man on the jury--  --but he was afraid.  They were all afraid--of my father-in-law. That man followed me last night-- he came from him of course.  My father-in-law will never give up. Never.  He promised me that.  So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As far away as I can get from North Carolina.  And it happens all over again.  Almost the same thing. Almost the same way.  Do you wonder about this--
If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
How are we going to get them all up there?
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
In about fifteen minutes.
Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
We better, Congress invented him.
Oh, no.
There was.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I know.
I was being foolish?
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
You're so sure of that?
Aren't you? After today?
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
That's your way, not mine.
That's God's way!
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.

I'm a dentist
And how long have you been a dentist?
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
Lovely.
Wow you are out of it.  
Yeah. Cool.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Very cool. Trippy.
I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
But you will always be here?
Me?
You will always!
I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming.
Who is he?
You really want to know?
Yes.  Tell me.
You like spaghetti?
You know I love spaghetti.
Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Yeah.  The big E.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
Yes.  Please.  Please.  The police  can be...
Were both thinking the same thing, right?
Do you know a friendly cop?
Yeah, just a nick ...
Breakfast.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
Forget it.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
No.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
Fear and ignorance.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Someday you can.  We all believe that...
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
You know what happened.
No, I don't.
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
And what do they know?
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
That's right.
That's not enough.  Tell me.
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
It can't be possible.
Gertrude!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
You look alike.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Not her brand.
She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.


  
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
I wish you were coming with me.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
No - I'll have you after
No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Where's it coming from?
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Is it coming from our own computer?
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
I know him.  I saw him.
Good.
Hunh?
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
We know there's another stocker.
Where?
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
Uh, let's go sit down.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
Anderton, leave.
Well then who can?
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
What are you saying?
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
Law enforcement?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Are you sure about this?
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/STAIRWELL - DAY.
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
What.
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
...who among us is in a position to say...
...He told them to look at me--look at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake...
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
As long as it gets us out of here
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
That would be great.  It better help.  What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
Oh, I do too, sir.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
That's three.
And that's one!
What'd I say?
That you were fired.
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Because of today?  The beach?
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
I know you did....
I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Then, close the case.
I better keep looking.
Where, how?
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
It's got to make sense some way.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
Yeah, you bet!
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
Don't move. We --
-- should go back. Now!
No. Don't --
I'm in charge. We go back!
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
Lose 'em.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
... without a shred of manners.
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now.  I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers!
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
Just save me a little patch and I'll do it later.
We're on our way there now...
Au contraire, mon cher.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
And that's how you got me in the first place.
Nah. Just you.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Okay.
What was it?
Nothing.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
"Francis Macomber."
Wha?
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
Guys!!! The shuttle?
I think so.
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Shut up.
Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
Mph rm.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Naw, I already ate.
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
Well as it turns out I did.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Who do you want?
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
No problem.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
A nap?
Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
What color?
Red.
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
But...
Nell, what do we do?
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
She's off her fucking rocker--
--I know!
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
--a <u>lot</u>.
Heather.
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Shoot.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
I'm promised to another!
What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Till then.
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
Yes.
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Yes.
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
How much?
Nine thousand dollars.
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
We have to keep moving.
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
How do you know this...?
... Simple logic.
Did it seem short to you?
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
But don't be too lenient.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
A murderer?
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
A female criminal!  Now that's news!
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
What do you mean, without him?
He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
Does he know that?
What's on your mind?
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
Some things you don't get over.
Linnea?
Yes. Who's this?
I'm here.
Who is this?
Tom. You remember?
I'm not sure. Where?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Yes.
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
...for the beans, yes...
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
I know.
I missed...
... Me, too.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Fuck you.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Not gonna let me in?
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
Huh?
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
It's so late.
Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
I'm ready.
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
Anything?
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
Buddy Deeds--
Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
EXT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
You raised me, like a son.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
You killed my parents.
I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
That depends on the man.
When did you first find out he was alive?
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
And Laszlo?
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
All except one. He won't have you.
No...
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
What're you talkin' about?
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
Well that's good to know.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
I would have stayed there if I could.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism  if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
Nicholas...
Get us out!
The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
You killed my daughter.
I am not flexible on this.
Alright. Let's do it.
To Castle Couer de Noir?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
That very nice.
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
Then you would have gotten your money?
Yes.
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? 
Tails.
Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
Nobody goes there anymore.
I don't know. Had dreams.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
Nick, you're so strange...
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
Get your clothes on, lady --
GET OUT!
You're under arrest.
Thank you, my love.                                         ]
So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
Wow!
Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this.
Yeah.  I got it.
Go.
Anyone particular in mind?
You.
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
Scared.  Can't talk.
So?
You know what I'm saying.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.
I remember.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Guilt?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
It isn't any better.
Where's June today?
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Where you goin'?
I don't know.  Depends what train I get on.
Not from forty feet.
No car.
The fuck not?
You know the fuck not.
Fuck.
Don't swear it's impolite.
Why?
It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger --
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
I won't.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
No!
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
It wasn't that bad.
Did he -- you know?
What?
You know.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
He made me lick it.
God, you're sick.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Cut it out.
When are you going to visit him?
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
It was good.
It felt good.
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
... Not at all.
You sure?
Absolutely positive.
Okay.  In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
Shut your mouth!
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
Yeah.
Oh, I would love to hear it.
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Something like that.
Need a nurse?
Youre a nurse?
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
What happened when you were twelve?
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
Of course.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
I know. It's up to us.
No.
I've got to ask somebody.
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
He's not Army, it's not official --
Then it's unofficial.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
More of a game really.
What kind of a game?
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me...
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
Great.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
Hi, Shari.
Who's Shari?
Who's --
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
Sure.
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
So we go to the bar.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
We'll take care of it.
And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
How are you today?
Fine thank you.
That's good.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
It ain't your locker no more.
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Baby, you did fine.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
...Baby...
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Baby, we're money.
Strength in numbers!!
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
I don't know.  My friends...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
Yeah, it is...
But can't you give me any idea?
How could I?  I will do my best. After all, you see, I am financially interested.
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
You like it?
I always did.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
Thirty-four.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
Water and Power?
Joe, the writer?
Just him and me.
I never heard nothin' about it.
Yes, ma'am.
We've looked at half of one tape.
Little rum in yours, too?
I guess so.
Father ... Father!
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
Why?
You have to start getting into your character.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Big Bill
No... no training.
Psych major?
English Lit.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
No, I ' m not.
Thought you were dead.
Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
Please.
Thank you.
The pepper, too?
No, thank you.
You're very welcome.  Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart-- Countess, you are a thief.  The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket.  In fact, you tickled me.  But your embrace was so sweet ... 
Doesn't matter....
Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
No.
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Good plan that.
Number five with a bullet.
Is there any blood in it?
I don't know.  Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.
That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Oh, don't be such a victim.
No!
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
Pass the fucking catsup.
Yes.
You're the first -- you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first person I could stand to be with.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
No.
I beg your pardon?
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Only on a first name basis.
That's cute.  You're funny.
That's funny, you're cute.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
What's wrong with it?
Nothing.  I think you really blew the lid off nookie.
How're you doing, Sarge?
For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
I don't see why not.
But what if---it wasn't real?
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
Sean!  Catch it!
I suspected as much.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
What do you mean?
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
When was this?
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Different?
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
A trifle.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
And what had you done?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Then what was it?
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
Then why did she object to you?
Because she was afraid.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
I don't understand.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
She already has a daughter.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
I see.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
I did.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
And the second?
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
I'm supposed to.
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
She's watching the car again?
Yeah.
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
Thank you.
Perhaps I'll see you in church.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
Two cents.
Have you slept with him yet?
I told you I slept with him.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I guess.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
If any!
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Well now that's a little more Like it.
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
I am your king!
Well, I didn't vote for you.
You don't vote for kings.
Well, how did you become king, then?
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ...

It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.

She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
How does someone get meningitis?
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
... or lemme guess -- toxic waste?
How the fuck should I know!!
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders, the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero, this master murderer who killed without pattern, killed literally hundreds of victims -- male, female, old, young, straight, gay -- and who was still killing, even though there were no bodies. It went against everything we knew. Low became increasingly paranoid. Every suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. Anybody tried to talk sense into him, he'd accuse them of being out to get him. Deputy Director Koessler was "out to get him." The decision was made to relieve him.
Thought you was followin' me.
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Fine.
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
You sure I'm not fat?
It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
Peter Valerian.
Sounds like a Russian general.
Yavol.
Pete, what happened to you?
Ace of spades.
Well, why should I?
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
I guess.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Yeah.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Whatever helps you cope.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
...not the pit.
More bang for the buck.
Where are the women?
They should be here any minute.
Roger that.
It wasn't in the cards.
You're damn right I am.
I do not get cold.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
Yes, Sir.
You've got it, Wendell.
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Yeah.
Does Osborne agree?
Yeah.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
That sounds nice.
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Listen to you.
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
- The family jewels?
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
I've got something in my bag.
Oh, it's not bad.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
I had you covered.  From back there.
Shit.
An error.
Well, sir...
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
I... I think I can... clarify...
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
What?
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
Exactly.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Then don't go out with me.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
Just get the fuck outta here.
I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
No. I never was.
Could've fooled me. Go away.
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
Naw, it's... I mean...
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Wheres my real dad?
I dont know...
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
Is this a bad time?
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
Okay.
Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
I don't believe you.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
You daft prick!
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
You needn't use that language with me
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
I wanted it
There's a different between want and
Not for me.
But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be "turns" with us, too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though - about yourself. Yes or no?  Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
We're gonna have to talk...
I said I was sorry.
Did you hear it?
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
What?...
...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
We're lucky to be alive.
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
No way.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
How 'bout this one?
Might be tight.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
What?  What did you say?
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
It's not bad. but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
Tell her I'm eating.
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Yes.
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
What kind of trouble are you in?
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
No. Me! Me!
Yer late.
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Not particularly.
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
I love Lucy!
You nut!
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
He sure is pixilated.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
I already did that.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
That I do.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
I took them out.
Why?
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
I'll never forget you, Maude.  But I would like a photo of you.
Are you afraid of heights?
I'm not following you --
They're next on the list.  We have to find them.
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
What do you want to change about this moment?
Nothing.
There's thousands of units like this one.
They're everywhere.
The escape bubbles?
Relax, will you.
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
I always thought it was nothing but red.
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
What about that D.B. Cooper guy?
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
Take a look.
I guess so. Follow me.
You dying.
...did they...
Would you excuse us, please...?
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
What?!  You aborted our child?!
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
You're not ready.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
Yes.
I'll never forgive you.
I know.
I have no idea who you are.
How beautiful.
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
I'm dying.
Hurry up!
Just a minute.  I'm shaking!  Take the gun.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
Gravity.
Get the hell in.
The day you got me out of jail?
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
Uh-huh.
I have a television.
NO--!
What makes you think so?
... Just a perception.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
Pain causes it?
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
No.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Well, play it, man.
I'm going to leave now.
You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Shocking abuse of authority.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
Such as?
You - for one. I told her you were set on Margo playing the part - and I certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Attraction is a complication?
It can be.
It happened to you before?
Yes.
Who was she?
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
What happened to her?
She was taken.
Did you --
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
Was she the only one?
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
Is this becoming complicated?
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
Jennifer Wilson.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
I owe you that. Done.
Nonsense.
Not according to the computer.
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
They're composers, Worf, from the nineteenth century. Data was rehearsing a part in H.M.S. Pinafore before he left...  "A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His energetic first should be ready to resist A dictatorial word..."
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
What is the...?
Arrest him.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Sid I can see you!
Where are you Dewey?
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
I'm ... your son ...
Not you.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Well, he is a very willful boy.
I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
What?
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
The bomb, asshole!
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
You know what I want, babe?
What?
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
Your type will soon be extinct.
Then I'll call you a cab.
I'll save you the trouble.  I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Who has?
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
Sometimes, sure.
Good. I was concerned.
What?
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Got cash.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Check.
Mints?
Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Let go!
Stop being nuts!
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
I do care about you!
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
Get the fuck outta my chair.
At the end of every chapter --
Okay.
Fine.
What?
What are you looking at?
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
How about right now?
Him?
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
What?  Assessing fines?
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
You got to be kidding.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
How is this legal?
Legal... illegal.  These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.
Why me?
Be a gentleman.  You have to help me down.
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
We're working on it.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
We're doing our best, sir.
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
It's wonderful.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
Huh?
I say, to most people it's a washout.
That depends on what they see.
Now, what do you see?
Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
What?
They're hauling Misery into court.
That's nice.
"There is a justice higher than that of man--I will be judged by Him."
Mmnph.
Hurry...
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
Only if he can be trusted.
He'll do what I say.
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
You know that can't happen.
Oh, why is that?
Why is that, Louis?
Bel Air is restricted.
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
Try?
Of course!
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country. 
S.O.P..
Who am I?
Yeah...Who?
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
I don't recall.
More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
That what you want?
That's what I want ...
Okay.
Thanks.
Head.  Not heart.
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
Sounds great, well you give 'em both one of these for me.
I stole it. From a synagogue.
Never?
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
What is it?
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
I don't know.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
One drop?
It's strong stuff.
Someone wants to play with me?
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
I did.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
Whatever you say, Jude...
Yes, well, they are.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Is that important?
Uh, well ...
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
There was no one outside.
There WAS.
What did he look like?
The bogyman!
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
Right.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Promise?
I promise.
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
Fuck off, Dave.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
Fire! I hate fire!
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
You're talking about complicity.
I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
Whoa, Daddy.
Hi Mom.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
I thought I'd wait for you.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
He's full of shit.
I am not going to let you get me into an argument, goddamn it.  Not tonight.  Now get in bed.
Are you sorry she's dead?
Of course I am.  What kind of question is that?
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
Later on.
Then I'll come back, then.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
Very good, sir.
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
Get away, get away!!
He drinks.
He's got a reason.
That's the train with all the lights.
Huh?  What?
You finished here?
What?  Yeah.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
Some of them...
Attacked how?
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
You didn't believe her?
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
Why not?
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
And the police did nothing?
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
How could you?
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
The word is Mob.
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
Who were they?
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
Yeah.
What do you feed him?
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Does he bite?
He never bit me.
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
Could develop.
Let me see what you get, but don't jump--The New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans.
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
Superman gets mail here?
Well of course.
Good. Just tell him I was here, that I'm sorry I missed him--
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
Uh huh, why?
See food!
Ready when you are.
Fifty minutes.
Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!
You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
The catacoombs?  Whaddya want, a door?  There's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in Istanbul.
I guess.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
What's that?
You can't drink.
Go ahead!
They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
Who are you talking to?
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
But you did -- I just heard it.
It wasn't me.
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
He was with me?
I can run out and get it.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
I can't be staying long anyway.
How long then?
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
You a blue-moon fool.
Then we'll do something else.
What else?
Trust me.
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
Trust me.
The one you bought at school.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
Yes.
And she wanted to talk.
Yes.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
Leo, I don't know.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
It's Ellie's cat.
Nope. He's your cat now.
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Ah, but that is just what I cannot teach. I cannot teach her to have a soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *Done* with the fingers, yes. But the music, she is inside. Inside, monsieur...
For what?
For the letters, of course.
I just talked to her.
A key party?
You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Having fun.
Is this fun?
Driving?
Driving, talking to me...
They're both a challenge.
You have a great profile.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
This one.
You sure?
Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.
That your cousin is more to your taste.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Right behind you.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
And they made the first move?
Unfortunately, yes.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
I know, I know who wrote it.
What?
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
You what?
I didn't know what was on it.
That's nice.
So you're going to Michigan?
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Onions?
What?
You want onions?
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
I know.  Salt and pepper?
Sure.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Yes you did.
Deck ten.
I understand.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
I know.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Why the gun?
I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
Uh-huh.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Yeah.
That's fuckin' combat.  The man in the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy fuckin' adversary.
Fuck 'em. Their loss is our gain. Put the money in the safe until we hear from Claremont. <b>
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
Who, Father?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
There IS no one.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Now don't give me a hard time.
What do you want from me, Father.
Your gun.
Mind your own business, Father.
This is my business.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Give me that gun.
You go to hell.
What did you say?
You go to
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
How does it work?
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
No.  I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley.
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
What do you think?
Now, you make a toast.
To new worlds...
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
You'll have to settle for turkey.
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
What can we do' mate?
Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
Mother... go away!
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Oh.  Well, for Blackie then.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
James? My James? What's happened?
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Kidnapped? By who?
His parents.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Maybe... I don't know.

I... I brought you something.
A cigarette?
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
I don't want to.
I believe you. Please...
Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
Four in this block, sir.
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Not a chance, my dear fellow. The Ggovernment can't be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories. Soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political offenders. Common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis. Kill the criminal reflex that's all. Full implementation in a year's time. Punishment means nothing to them, you can see that... they enjoy their so-called punishment. Alex seizes his chance as they pass by.
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Who cares?
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
Of course you can.
What?
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
No kiddin'.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Sure, Sid.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
- canker sore.
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
That he was.
They're making him a hero now.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Can't argue that.
So what was he?
I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
Where is she?
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
It's late.
Yes.
Who?
Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.
Is that what he tells you?
He doesn't have to tell me.
Yes...
And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
No.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Yes.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
Yes.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Mocky-Lock.
Oh no... No you don't.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
I bet we can fix it.
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
How so?
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
...And everyone lived happily ever after.
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
I lied. Wait for it...
...It looked money.
No way Doug, I can't.
Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
What?
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
Ha ha ha!
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
Or relieve me of it later.
Only I was sloppy.  I let you take me out.  That was quite a humiliation.
She wants a divorce.
Don't talk like that.
It's over, finished and done with.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?
John...
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
These two holes are yours...
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
You don't want to hear about it?
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
Right...
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
That sounds nice.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
Pardon me?
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
What's the profile?
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
How can you, how can you say that?
Because he's guilty.
No, no he's not.
We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
Youre not going to.
Let yourself in.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
I assume you want something?
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
You want me to help you get out of the country?
No.
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
Where are you going?
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
--you're hopeless!  You can't even read a sentence!  Didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  The game ends tonight!
What, working security?
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
Yes.  Are you shaking?
No.
You're shaking.
I don't think so.
You're cold.
I don't think I am.
Then why are you shaking?
I don't know.  I'm happy.
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
My non-denial denial.
See you on the bounce !
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
AGAGAH!!
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
You're a drunk fool.
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Nothing.
Ready.
But you're a superhero.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
But in fact... you'd found it.
Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
What if I don't want it?
Tough.
Clean?
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
And clean.
Yes. Very clean.
Fifty pounds? What for?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
No, then.
I didn't hear anything.
You know how much it is, Nick.
And that does include the amp?
You know it doesn't include the amp.
But I'll never win that.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
Really?
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
Thank you.
Why?
Why?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you two, uh - - are?  I wish you the best luck.
Where is he?
We're too late. Take a look.
Yes?
See them two big trees across there?
Yes?
And the white house?
That's where the Brenners live.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
The two kids?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
I see. How do I get down there?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Mmmm.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Mmmm.
It's a surprise, you see.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Where would I get a boat?
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Of course.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Thank you.
What name?
Daniels.
Okay.
No, sir.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
Right, Chief.
So...? Where the hell is it?
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
Yes, sir.
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
And many meatballs.
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
A misunderstood bachelor.
I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
Did you tell Sterling?
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Thank you.
How much do you think you'll need?
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
You get paid to do what we say.
This is Jason's fault!
Not another word, do you hear me??
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
Thank you, ma'am.
I want to ask you something.
Airport Ho-Jo!
I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
Not very good!
Right here.
And you're sure about this?
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
Cunt.
Jesus...
As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned the worst has happened, the Panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in Vietnam.  By doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction.
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
Policy man in Queens.
What about the last of the big-time spenders.  You make him?
Dave.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
For them. But for me --
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
Come on!
Luminal.
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
Yeah...but no ties.
No ties.
No...
He said he traveled for two months.
I took a different route.
Well, that's different.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Of course.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
We're not leaving Crutch!
We don't have time to argue!
Tom, the Welsh dude --
What about Mrs. Marschal?
She died a long time ago.
I know.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Why not?
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Yeah?
Not all of them.
When you finish, what then?
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
You make it all sound so simple.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
You want me to front for you.
The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
You were ALL human!
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
I'm fine dad.
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...
Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
We're through!
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I'll get it.
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
But...
Well, I met someone...
Fast work. You just moved here.
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
He sure did.
What?
I said I'm sure he did.
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
I'm glad.  I'm very glad.
He has Israel.
Those aren't Jews.
Of course they're Jews.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Are all Jews the same?
Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Come on in--
If it's too late--
Come on in.
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
Who with?
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Lose?--I won a little--
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
What do you know about them?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
You can live that down, can't you?
He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Who? Tell me!
M-M-Muh-Muh-McMurphy!
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Hey, you couldn't know.
I still feel like shit.
Then this won't matter.  LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
I am -- it looks horrible!
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
Why should it?
That's right... Take one of these.
What is it?
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
But it's...
Please, Ed.
Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
It's an amazing gift.
We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
If you want to do it.
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
Do we care?
I think we Nought to wait.
I say we go.
You say we go?
Do not inhale.
I'm not ready.
Here we go.
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Yes.
I don't want to scare people.
I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems.  Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
Good. So do I.
Careful. Check his pulse.
Where?
In there.
It frightens me.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Then..then what's that music?
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
Something's making that music.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
Departmental policy.
You?
Then I'll see you in Hell.
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
I beg your pardon?
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
Good title.
And yours?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
What is the story?
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Ethel.
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
The daughter of his enemy.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
Mercutiogood name.
-- what?
I don't know what gets into me.
You were great.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
No you didn't.
You don't think so? I do.
You were great.
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
He's got you worried, then?
Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.
We didn't get that far.
Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
By who?
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
You heard right.
You really are one dumb asshole.
Life is unpredictable.
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
I didn't see nothin'...
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
I know... I remember.
Well?...
I ain't heard of nothin'.
Thanks...
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
Please.
What do you drink?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
Our own special bus.
How do you know it's for us?
Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
Can he save her?
No.  Her case is too advanced.  But maybe, someday, with more research-
Nothing.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
You'd probably tell me.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
You have to be kidding.
Yours will do!
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
That's the hard part.
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
That's some serious poundage in dollars.
The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
It's not nice to be evasive.
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
How was your plane ride?
The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away.
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
I guess...
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
They're okay.
You alone, or you got confederates?
I'm not alone.
How many you got in there?
I got Sal.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Does she know about us?
Jesus, she's my best friend.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself!  Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there?
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
When so ordered.
We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five. 
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
Here we go.
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Of him I think.
Did she say that?
More or less.
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
Yes. That is correct.
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Wayne Gretzky.
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
Okay.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
YES!!!
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
If he does ...
I was attacked.
<u>What</u>!
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
<u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!
Nope.
Me neither.
Who'd you ask?
Tina Wilcox.
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
That's a crock of shit.
I know.
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
And what of these foreigners?
I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.
Back at you.
Thank you.
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
'Intimate? !"
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
My ticket?
I found it on the seat.
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
How many men have we seen die?
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
It is ended.
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
Arthur wants to quit!
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to?
Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
This morning.
Where was I?
You were asleep.
He told you and you let him do it.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
If you say so.
Yes.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Neither am I.
Okay  what can we lose?
Damn.
And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
Oh, I'm captivated.
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
Have you seen him?
Alex, I don't have the time --
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
No.
Only me and Mom ..
How about any guys on your staff?
We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
What is hitchhike?
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
What are you going to do?
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Uh...
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Yes.
Vat about it?
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
You're not, as you Americans say, dragging my leg, are you?
Good?
Mm.
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was you, wasn't it?
It was me, what?
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
My God...
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
Is it your dish?
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
How'd I know it was for you?
Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you.
You said go between them!
I said don't go between them!
No way.
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Yes, it's a miracle.
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
No rust?
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
Meaning?
Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
I thought we were poor.
Not that poor.
The Upper West Side.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Well maybe you should date him.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
They may be right.
What am I supposed to do?
Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
What did you say?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
Thank you. No more questions.
... Or <u>who</u>.
He got off on six.
We have four rooms and six suites on six.  There's a man in almost every one of them.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
Luther's on the move...
Deploy.
Oh.
Hey...hey...it's okay!
Yeah!
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
What way?
Like there's someone else here.
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
I will.
If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy.
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
I won't.
Get into bed.
I will.
Good luck.  You think they got families?
I know, Terrance. I know.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>.
La what?
La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Should I?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
So you havent seen the film, then?
Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Oh... We split up.
Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
Oh no. Im all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
Give this to Joey, will you?
Oh.
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Accelerators down.
Sounds good.
Why not?
Because --
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
What did you think?
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
<i>It was the beginning of the end.</i>
Yeah, that's so.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
And this makes you "sad"?
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
My name's 
I can hardly hear you.  Could you spell that?
Huh?
Forget it.
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Nothing.
Why did we stop?
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
Yes, I do.
You'll see.
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,  Gimme the goddam keys.
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
From where -- Neptune?
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
By stealing my car?
I would've come back for you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I call it my shower dream.
I'm not going to give you my keys.
I don't ski.
Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a look around.
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
Rogue?
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
You could say that.
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell 
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
Yeah.
Then why are you looking for her?
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
It's not going to let us out!
How do you know?
Some things never change.
Um, no.
Let's move into this neighborhood.
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
And you know this for a fact?
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
So?
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
Whoo!
I made it!
 I made it.
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
You okay?
What the fuck was that?!
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
Gee, you think so?
Holy--!
 Okay.  That didn't work.
 Gee, you think so?
Shut up!

Ho, ho...
 Oh...
...ho!
 ...shit!

 
Hang on!
Hey!


Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?
What do you want?
This is great Rachel. Come on.
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
I get the picture.
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
Message to Proteus.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
Jesus...Jesus!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Oh...
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
Dr. Pamela Isley.
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
I see you knew him.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
Brave... that's right.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
Fuck.
Yes.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Yes.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
I will relay the message.
Alright, thanks.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
You did not know?
Well...no, not really --
You and he are not doing things?
No!
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
Yes.  I trust you.
Our greenhouse.
Oh, I like that very much.
Yes, so do we.
That... was... no... simulation.
I know. I'm sorry...
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
-- You can and you will.
You're finished.
And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
The device has stopped responding.
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Come on!
All right, I'll try...
They tried... but I didn't let them.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Who are you? What is your name?
I don't know, [I tell you].
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
And I love poetry above all.
Above Lord Wessex?
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
...tell them...
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
That's right, Major.
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
Doesn't fit.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
That information's being withheld from the media.
A very sexy case.
Oh... Thanks.
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
He looked too shaken-up.
WHAT?
I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?
Remember my promise.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
But we saw Earth destroyed.
And Earth will be destroyed -- just as we saw it.  Only, since fleeing it, we have passed through a....backward disturbance in time -- did you notice the Date Meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship? -- and we have returned to Earth almost two thousand years before its destruction.  That is another reason for keeping silence.  Our human captors would not be edified to know that, one day, their world will crack like an egg and fry to a cinder, because of an Ape war of aggression.
What's the decoy?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Shoot!
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
How so?
I'm bored.
No, he showed me one.
Honey...
I knew we'd pay for it.
I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
What did she say?
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
Now!
Yes sir.
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
Fern. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.
Yes.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Yes. What is it you want?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Waitin' in the lounge.
How 'bout Mallory?
Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
You ready?
Are you coming to eat with us?
Your honors, the State rests.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
That's right, me.
What?
That's a ridiculous move.
Why?
Because, I'll take it.
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
You wanna let me see your license, please?
I admit, I can be bought.
Shut up and open the door.
Why not?
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
I like the sound of that.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
Options.
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Gentlemen?
On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
For ever and ever.
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
You have a stunt bottom?
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Both.
See ya, Kate.
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
Why not show Dr. Furtwngler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Please. Look...
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
We don't take hints.
Shut up and catch.
What?
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Milo --
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Milo, you --
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
Will you still get the money from your father?
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
We own a small family grocery store.
No?
Should we close down any eruption?
Are you sure?
We're seeing all the signs in town.
I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
At your house. Don't you remember?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
At your house.
That's absurd.
Are they fighting?
No baby. We'll all be right in.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
Yeah, he's aces.  Thanks, Turk!
Allow me.
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Awful lot of money.
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
Damn!  All right, wait a minute...
Mathilda, listen!
No, no! I don't want to go!  I don't want!
Sonny...?
Yeah.
Where's Riccardo?
On the phone.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Sure...
It brings out my eyes...
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Okay...
Not quite...but keep trying.
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Just put it in your purse.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
No way, Jos.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Put it in your pants.
No.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Read my lips.
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
She always looked out for me.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
Shhh...
Hey, little Dale Evans.
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Hurry -- hurry --
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
No, really?
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
I know, I know, and your hamster.
Yes!
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
Dead Cat?
Yeah.
Well it sure looks dead enough.
Okay.
Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone.
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
Hang on...  Remember that Cessna we saw at the pumping station on the Haul Road?  Belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline.
Yes.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Yes...
But, but but but...
No, no, I see...
That: in an act of...
Yes...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
I understand...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
As the Old Mill goes around...
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
Of course.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech.  Just you.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
Whoo!
I can see that.
What?  What's wrong?
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
You see any cops?
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
What's that supposed to mean?
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
Thanks.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
Er, good luck, yes.
I'd better be going.
Er, my check, please.
I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
On the night table.
But I don't want to be a lady.
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
How do you know if you've never tried?
This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
Did you say formal? I must dress.
No.
Not at all?
No.
But why not?
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
We're just closing, friend.
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
That's real big of you.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
...Huh?
What kind of man *are* you?
Big Dave--
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
I, uh...
I'm not proud of what I did. But *you*.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
No.
You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
Heat's murder.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Ya know, I was.
Really?
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
It sure is.
They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/ANDY'S OFFICE - DAY. 
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
Is it hard?
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
Oh ... Right.
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Like big lizards.
...and every one of them stacked naked...
What is... Make Love?
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
Miss, we are going to ask you to sign this little sheet of <u>paper</u>...
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
Too late, it's written.
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
Here here!
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Well, maybe you think I could!
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
That ring--
Masons been around a long while.
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
I want to come back.
I have no idea.
Of course.
Thank you.
Yes.
Hawkins?
I can't tell.
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
Think about it!  Just think about it!
What about the share.
You get fifteen percent.
I got partners.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
And the Jews?
Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
So, we need to get to the source.
First paycheck?
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
Actually, I volunteered.
A G...g...g...
A Grail?
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
What is that?
This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
No.  Until I come and get him.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Ours.
Oh, I see.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
But I don't have it.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
Did he put you up to this?
Who?
Graham.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
God, you... you're mean.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
No, John, things are getting real simple.
I am. I am, sir.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
Are you...okay?
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
That's good. Terrific.
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Uh. . .
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
...what's he got against you?
 He once made me an improper suggestion.
I have cheerleading squad.
Skip it.
Sure.
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
Bullshit.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
No more.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
Don't tell him --
Shut up, Violet!
He can't kill you --
Nothing.
Nothing?
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
Why? What's wrong?
You are a valued customer, as you know.
But what's wrong?
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
What is?
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
But they must be! They cut glass!
Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
Just asking.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Not to mention on me.
No, you're not.
...Nancy?
Sheldrake?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Oh!
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
The roller disco one.
Fourteen.
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
Get on the bus.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Just get on the bus.
I'm not leaving without her.
John, you can't help her now.
What?  Where is she?
John...
Lady?
Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
I think a little of both.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
Get a boob job.
For a little while.
Fine.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
I know.
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
That's nice.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
No! Do they show you having sex?
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
At what point?
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
You would?
Yes, I would!
Like that?
Like that!
I know all your tricks.
And you're going to fall for them.
So you think you can get me?
Any minute I want!
You're conceited--
But attractive--
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
<u>Shut</u> <u>up</u>--<u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>!  Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments! 
No!
Ugly, vicious rumous.
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
So?
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
None I'd like to share.
Collected shoes too?
He may have a gun!
Oh, for God's sake!
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
Yes.
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
Thank you-
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
I never learned jazz.
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
I'm not catching a melody.
That's the point.  You play <u>between</u> the notes, you dance <u>around</u> the structure, you improvise.  Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now.  Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over.  That's not living.  That's dying a little every day.  Not me, pal.  It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living.  That's jazz.  That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about.  Hell, it's the same thing <u>he's</u> talking about, if you just open your ears.  You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet...
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
You're okay.
Yeah.
Did you know him?
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....
It's not even noon --
Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
So it's an honor?
No.
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
I haven't been a detective for four years.
You don't say --
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
I see.  I see.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
No word at all?
He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him.
The Colonel helped me work it out.
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
Thank you.
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
A few more days. We know who did this.
So do I.
No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.
Can I take your picture?
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Please?
Is that all?
Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
Because it ain't natural, young man.
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
I had him!
It's only gonna make you crazy.
Yes.
My Doctor Lady?
Mine, too.
Ah, no!
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
And a skunk stinks!
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
What did she want?
Who?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
What night?
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
What's suck night?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
Perv.
It's the best fork of all
The dessert fork!
Right away, Exposition.
Where is Vanessa, by the way?
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Jeffrey Mason?
Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
Why not?
It's a rebound.
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Six years.
But! I'm a married woman!
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
Sure.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Baked in a pie.
What's he doing here, Sid?
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
And Reynolds?
He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
Who's moving?
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Well, why don't you say it?
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Eighteen.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Too young or too old?
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
I said I got his machine.
No, what did you say on the machine?
I left him a message.
I know you left him a message. What did you say!
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
-- what guy?
-- this guy with Jill.
He's a director.
Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
Despite the lack of challenge.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
He married you, didn't he?
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
What about that apartment?
He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother?  You don't believe me, but it's true.  It just happens to be true.  He was really interested in my voice.  What are you smiling for?  What do you think he built that opera house for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't want to sing.  It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him.
We'll change your appearance.
And?
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Get her on-line.  Now!
He must be replaced.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
They sure do.
Late, very late.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
A few days ago.
That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
Yes, yes -
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
That's me.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Nine.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
Meaning...?
They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
We? I don't think so.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
I had a toothache.
Not unless we're blind.
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
Meaning what?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
We're your guys.
We don't need guns.
I'm pretty sure we do.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
All the more reason.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
Wanna bet?
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
It was six in the fucking morning.
Float me a hundred bucks.
Why?
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
You're out of money?
No.
What do you have left?
Eighty.
Eighty bucks?!?
Eighty five.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
You did?
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
What about it?
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
It frightens you.
Yes...
It was meant to.
What?
You lame or something?
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
Not much time.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
These machines -- They're in here.
Sean's still out there.
What?
How did you know I would be here?
Yeah, I've been busy.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
I'm literally going to kill you!
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
A pizza?!
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
Why don't you get to the point.
My point, well...
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Fuuuuuuck -- U!
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
A toupee that flies?
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
But why the hair?
That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
Yes. Thank you.
Yes.
Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
He's come to rescue me, father.
Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
Here.
There?
Here.
Here.
Feel anything?
No.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
It's not good...
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
I can' take you to a hospital.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Lie back down, and try to -
I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.
David... please...
I visited your home this morning, after you left.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
Look who's talking?  Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?
Relax, I got him.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
Look at the collar on that coat...
No!
Everybody goes home!
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
Don't let's lose each other.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
What are you saying?
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
You're forgetting who's in charge --
Word.
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
No harm no foul.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
But he didn't ask me.
But he does! Don't you see?
Where have you been?
Don't tell me.  Insects.
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
And I know what I'm talking about.
You like a good saloon?
It's the only place I'm happy.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
You starting that again?
Anybody cover?
I think they call it a pasture.
Right back where we started.
Shut up, Starling...
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
Sure, sure.
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Only in bad weather.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
-- Alright, alright but --
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
You try and have a good time.
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
I'll call them, okay?
It doesn't matter...
I'm going to call.
Do it for YOU.
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
I know...
What's up?
About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole.
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Did you get a doctor?
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
How?
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say "I love you". What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
Yes.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
What does arresting us get them?
You wanna tell him?
Like cancer with a purpose.
Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --
I don't like your following me.
I didn't follow you.
Then how did you get here?
I always eat here.
This is a place for workmen.
But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
Yyyess.
Yyess.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Yes!
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Yes.
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Hello...
My name is...
My... name is...
John Merrick.
John... Merrick
Say "Merrick".
Merrick...
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Hello... my name is... John Merrick.
It wasn't meant to be.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
I'm very cold.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Obviously.  Very difficult.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
We do not go into your courts.
People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
Oh, so you know.
Howdy.
Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.
What happened to her?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
No.
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
Sure.
Good.
No!  They're right here --
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
And it's proving quite effective...
Does it make the cars any better?
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Perceptual?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Why?
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Yes, but I wouldn't...
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
I'm a salesman.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Myra, I'm not following this.
Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square.
Fabulous.
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
Who's "Patty."
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said --  "When I grow up, I want to be divorced."
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
Find out who they are?
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Interesting.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Where at?
Palmdale.
Damn, that's a long drive.
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
I know what you mean.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
Brunette.
Slim, athletic, voluptuous?
To what?
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
What?
The "crises"?
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
Whatcha mean by that?
You know: how the voters are gonna play your divorce.
He, I'm Mona.
Hi, Mona.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Oh, is that what I'm doing?
In time.
No now.
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Do you think I'm strange?
Oh, leave off!!!
Temper! Temper!
Well ...
But have I...?  Ever...?!
Lothar, take your checks now.
Is that what you came here to say?
Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
Just stop worrying.
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
What's wrong?
I have to go to the Diplomat.
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
How'd you meet Early?
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
No ...
You can't sing at the competition.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.
But it went away...We would have known....
You think. That's what you're good at.
Look, youre making this into something its not. This isnt a referendum on our lives, Kate. Its a step forward...  Dont you see?  Im talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
Where do you want it?
This side.
OK, open the gate.
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Yeah.
You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
Let go of my hair.
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
Come and get him.
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too.  Even stole a Horse once.  But you can't--
Hmmm?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
That I am very little different from him.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Oh Frederick.
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
What's that?
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
Yeah.
Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
Good, I hate long waits.
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
I didn't throw him, he fell.
What'd he do to you?
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
How can you kill him like that?
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Who was he?
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
Tens of thousands killed before sundown.  Nobody's killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Did you bat an eye, Max?  Join Amnesty International?  No.  I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...
I'll be forced to tickle you.
I don't want to hurt you.
Go on - hit me!
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
You're the star.
Just trying to make it look real.
Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
I know, I know.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
Isn't that -- extreme?
What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
That's not quite what I said --
It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
No, I don't think so?
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
Sorry, I don't remember.
Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
I dunno.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
I dunno.
She was always a rotten wife!  She was against everything manly you ever wanted to do.  He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit.  She made him become a life insurance salesman instead.
Is that your official response?
I don't have an official response, Michael.  All I have are the same questions you have.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
What?
Gray -- I'm rid of him --
Whenever you want.
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
No.  They've passed on.
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
We are looking for you.
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
What?
A man just called.  He asked her everything!
How about if I call you?
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
Good idea.
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
You're a big help.
Alright, the beige one.
I hate the beige one.
Don't wear the beige one.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
I'm not stopping.  I'm on my way.
He was watching a ball game on television.
What?
His wife changed the channel.
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
OK.
What is it, noontime?
Yeah. It does.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
We're not.
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
Yep.
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Are you saying she liked it?
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
You're talking to me?
Why do you polish it?
It won't be a problem.
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
Okey-doke.
We have to own this guy, Marion.  We don't want him dead; we need to use him.
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
Well, what a lucky break for me.
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
Sit down, the lot of you.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
OK. I'll think about it.
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
Mark 12.
I've got no stomach for murder.
It's a combat action.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
Then step aside.
No.
Get out of my way.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Oh... great!
Say, I want to be sure, too!
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
You flatter me, Caesar.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Caesar?
That this illness has clouded his mind.
Th.D.?
You can't.
Why?
Let me go.
Where?
To the church, I must go there.
Madeleine --
Please let me go.
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now. What is it you have to do, exactly?
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
Phooey on that.
You ain't dead.
Great.
While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five.
Those aren't mine.
Sure they are.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
I guess I am.
Well, think about it.
What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
That bad, huh?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Okay, friend. You're on.
Call it.
Heads.
Talk to your new girlfriend.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Cheap date.
Least she had time for me.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
You forgot to be there.
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
Stay!
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
Least you got your priorities straight.
I never asked you to choose.
Never had to.
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Overruled.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Hey...
Okay, "mom."
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
Excuse me.
In the new library there.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Depends how you define 'new'...
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Yeah. How'd you know?
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Four colors? Neato!
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
HARRY Dunne.
I don't know where to begin...
What are you talking about?
It's better you see for yourself --
You're right.  I better use two.
I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
What's the frequency?
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
Yes, sir?
How is she?
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Oh, no, sir. No different than
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sirshe sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Really?
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
Right.
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Oh!
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
Phew!  Weve got five minutes...
Oh?
Could I try that?
I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
Or even what it looks like.
Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
Uh huh.
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
Really.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I know what that's like.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Hell, they're all after the same thing.
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
You sure are a pretty lady.
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
I think I should.  3000W?
That's right.
Just move with me. Don't think.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
But surely...
I came this far alone ...
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Any clue as to what it is?
Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
We used to take baths together.
Come on. Let's go.
Those two musicians from the garage!
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here.  Come on.
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Your job, huh.
Not yet.
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
Why is it -- breaking up?
I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
I know.  If you're smart, you'll talk to Raymond.  That's the butler. You can learn a lot from him.  He knows where the bodies are buried.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
He's my father, Millie.
He's no father to you.
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Bye.
Can your man handle that?
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Can you set that up?
Sure.
Where's my ELT?
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
You got one?
It was blown up with the plane.
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What has happened?
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
No more about Beynon.
Whatever happens it's over.
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
Who gets the privilege?
No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
You couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl. Can you hold this?
About ten years.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
Spock...!
I have been -- and always will be -- your friend... Live. Long. And. Prosper.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
He's my teacher!
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
N...nothing.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
It's kind of overwhelming.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
What do you mean?
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
But they're all the same.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
Slow down, huh?
Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
What?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
Good, and then type up a notice on your computer for tonight's thing, photocopy it and put it up in all the faculty buildings and a couple of the pubs. It'll start at eight o'clock and the bar will be open from seven. Holly and I'll go and get some beer and wine.  Can you bankroll the bar for tonight?
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Knew what?
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
Because she asked me--and I couldn't very well turn her down. Don't you remember-- of course you don't remember--that "Hag" is the one who brought you to that hospital in Gotham City. For what it's worth-- currently not much--we owe her your life...When I think about a single woman in Gotham City--amnesia is probably the best thing that could happen to a girl like you...Oh, don't forget your visor.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
But why now?
I thought eighty was a good round number.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
And if it should take more time to get through --
I could not think of not accepting.
You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
Thank God...
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Hurry, Rose.
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
What?
Take your hands off me!
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
Lean on him.
There's a tunnel.
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Yes.
Isn't that rather too close...?
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
We can do it!
That little prick.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
That little prick.
I paid for it and everything.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
It's none of my business?
Yeah.
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
No, thank you.
You need to fill out those forms. Application, psych-tests: M.M.P.I. and T.A.T.  For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like.  We'll run a T.R.W....
Fairy tales?
Do you believe in them?
No.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
Woodsman?
The one with the ax?
I don't know.
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
Little Red Riding Hood.
That's it. Little Red Riding Hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch.  Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half?
What? Palace? Hardly.
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
What... is... happening... ?
Oh, that's a relief.
Jack.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Well, here you are.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
You're welcome. Rose.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Is he your boyfriend?
Worse I'm afraid.
Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
Kalen...
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
That's quite enough, Kalen.
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back
Well in that case, I saw your Horse.  Billy Clanton was takin' Him up to the Cut to show him Off.  The boys're all up there Right now, branding.  And in a Mood.  Still want your property Back, Mr. Private Citizen?
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Good.
I was just kidding around.
Good.
But why shouldn't I?
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
No.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
How you doin'?
Good.
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
What is its antidote?
I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
I'll take them both.
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Thought the weather terrible of late.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Maybe.
Oh god, Laura.
Well, why not?
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
I don't believe it, Jean  they're picking straws.
Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
Yes, sir.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
No, sir, none at all.
But it can't wait.
Oh... er... yes...
What if he did?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
But they would! Don't you see?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Why is it?
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
Would you like me to seduce you?
What?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
Who cares?
I know.
Well?
Otis!!!!
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
Otis!
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
Love?
You walked out on a five year marriage.
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
It's not like this all the time.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
And how hard it hit?
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
That is not true.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
Yup.
Well this didn't.
Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
One seventy-nine.
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
A half hour.
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
I should start.
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
With you? I don't think so.
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
Nothing personal.
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
...maybe...
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
You're a comedian?
Yeah.
What's that like?
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Are you sure? Maybe...
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
I'd say about two weeks.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
You better pay the man.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
Ta-ra.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought you were goin' fishin' up at Mile Lacs?
What-
Just do it!!
I know.
That way it sets.
Yeah.
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Marcia's living with a singer?
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Yes, Jim.
Strange.
But a good strange.
Is it?
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
Call what off?
The fight.
What fight?
This fight, pussy.
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
What nurses?
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Almsy smiles and walks on towards the others.
I'm...
Done?
Yeah, thanks.
No problem.
REALLY?
Really.
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
No.
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
The Fortress moves?
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
You have not slept in two days.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
Why?
I've got something for you.
A surprise?
You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
Maybe.
Where are they?
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
Where are they? Last chance.
Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
Good!  That's good!
We can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space.
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
There're no cars on this street.
SHIT!!
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
I really should get home...
That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
Sounds grim.
Yeah.    How was the job search?
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
Good, good.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
No.  I do not cook for them.  My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.
It's locked.
It's locked?
I refuse.
LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
No, I'm--
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson!
Alright, alright.
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five bills.
Five.  On credit.
This ain't a credit business.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
What things? Why?
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
Doc. Nice to meet you.
Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
Why not?
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
What?
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --
A hunch.  He might be able to...
Did you... kill him?
No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character.
I don't know.  Back the truck--
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Well, don't get carried away.
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
Good, I love swinging a shovel.
What are you having?
Iced tea.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
A blimp.
A turd.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
I know it well, sir.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
Sir?
That smell.  I mean, everybody suffered so much, their sons killed. They need to sacrifice something, y'know, appease the gods of war -- Mars, Jupiter.  I am that blood, General.  I am that sacrifice, in the highest place of all ... All leaders must finally be sacrificed.
I know.
And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain -- 
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
Here? In Berkeley?
Yes.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
But you're not enrolled.
No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
I'll drink to that.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
Hospital food.
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
<u>Liza</u>!
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
You've never seen her run.
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
They were gore before I came here.
But why?
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Why's his britches round his knees?
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
I'm just saying.
Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
Yes.
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
Increase his heart rate.
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
It would be an added stress to his heart.
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.  Your witness.
No trouble at all, really.
Better!
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
You didn't tell him about me?
No.
No. Why would I be?
Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.
What?
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Oh ....
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
Did they take your clothes?
No beer?
Not on the opening night, wouldn't look right.
Barely.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
What?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Great.  I love the Bahamas.
Yes.
We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Yeah, I'll be in.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
That makes him more than a hundred --
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Beating you away.
I'm gonna get me a drink.
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
I know you do.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
Um, no.
Goodbye, David.
How's that possible?
Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here.  I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
But we've got time.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
A blue rose.
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
Wait.
It was a test.
For what?
You keep saying that.
This time I mean it.
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
You don't seem all that proud.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
Heal who?
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
You're talking about the precogs...
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
Better. I was really angry.
Oui, doctor, oui.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
Oui.
You decide. Today is your day.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Oui. Perfect!
Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.
Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
Take your second position.
OK. Roger.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
They're Amish.
Me get heap firewater --
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
Roy?
Stand by, Powell.  I gotta check something out.
What's that?
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
I can't leave my job, George.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
More than you need me.
I need it.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
...and hypocrisy.
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
It burns.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
You feel the flesh crisping?
Can hardly wait to do it again.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.
It's so very nice to see you again.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
Forget it.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
They asked about you.
What did you tell them?
That I really don't know.
Now what?
They'll listen to what we say in here.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Oh -- but it can't be.
I got you, Del...
...well, then you ain't got much.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
Silence her!  Take her away...!
That's right.
But why Egypt?
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
It has its moments of uncertainty.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
No.
But, why?
Because you wish it.  
You have a lot of secrets.
I guess.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Oh, Mr. Deeds
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
No.
Why not?
I'm looking for potential.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
God help us, he's hungry too.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
You are being ripped open.
I know.
Did you bleed?
I didn't bleed.
You didn't?
No, I didn't bleed.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
We don't know that.
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
Well someone's gonna find them.
Hell, it won't be us!
I'm sure I don't know.
We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
Yes, you should go.
But then when will we see each other?
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
You'll see before long. Let's go.
Jesus Christ ...
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
Did it do you any good?
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
Aw, he isn't that good...!
How can you say that when you don't know him!
A station wagon in Canada.
What's her greatest fear?
Her brother.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
No. It's her brother.
What stinks so bad?
Our friend, the shark.
We can show her the schoolyard.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Our first order of business is survival.
Uh, huh...
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
You and Charley?
You were messed up, man.
But look at me now...
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
I'm at the airport.
Good. Get to a phone.
You've broken its leg!
We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.  Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?
You didn't say anything about my hair.
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Isn't there an easier way?
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
Piss.
Diet coke.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Can I have some chips?
-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
Thanks, I see him...
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
It doesn't say that.
No, but it should.
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
Mine?
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
Yes, sir.
What is it?
Listen.
No, there isn't.
And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be.  And I can't handle it.
Go back to China, bitch!
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
Rowan.
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
That sounds like their problem.
I'll be right there.
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
B-but I have them.
No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
My help?
A little bit... Give me your belt.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Okay, give me my belt.
-- What do you think?
Yes. I wrote it.
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
Huh!
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
Coming.
To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
Where would you go to sell a chip?
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Who made you do this?
Kill me!
Tell me!
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
She's a bird, Willow.
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Watch it!
Ahhh!
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
What is it?
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
Sir, with all due respect....
And hey, I appreciate it...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
Nothing.
The very same.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
I plan to grow on you.
You're off to a late start.
So noted.
Exactement!
I'm honored to know this man.
There...
You certainly have a nice place here.
Well stocked.
Charlie -
Yes?
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
Why not?
Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Maybe we can catch it.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
These are really swell! I mean swell!
Is that OK?
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
It must come.
Well don't.
I forgot.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Oh my God you're having an affair.
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
You, Numa?
I love you.
I love you.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
Good.
Maybe they lied to you.
Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
I'm all right.
You ever done time before?
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
'Preciate it. Claude.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Unless the gun was slanted up.
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me.
I'm used to you...
No.  You think I'm a hero.  I'm no hero.  I'm nice to people where it pays me to be.  I gotta do it too much on the outside, so don't expect me to kow-tow in my own office.  I'm in a bind right now with Hunsecker so --  Every dog has his day!  Lock up and leave the key.
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
Kay... Kay...
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
He's not the same as when I met him.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
You drink at 10 am, do you?
No -- no -- I mean--
I wanna see the picture today
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
He personally asked you to?
That's right
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
Knox Overstreet.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
I would.
Thomas?
Victoria -
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
When do you think it'll be done?
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
What do we have to do?
My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV.
Yeah... Sid?
You got clicks, anything?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
Jesus, Tom, do they work?
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
Go on, beat it!
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
Thanks for nothing, you bum.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
It would be a nice change from you.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
How'd you ever get away with it?
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Sure!
I never want to go back....
Then let's go. Now!
I haven't finished my drink.
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
I can't let you do that either.
Because you're afraid!
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
I could force you.
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
Yeah. You?
Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.
Yeah.  Big time.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
What did you want?
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle.
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
Put your head back.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
Because I'd met someone else.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You believe that?
I do if you do.
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
Must be in love to manage that.
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
I know, I know.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
And if you get it right -- you die.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
... I see.
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Yes. I've seen that done.
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.
Will he yield for a question?
Ah, now, that's better.
Will he *yield*?
For a *question*.
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
It does!
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
Mr. President--
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
I have no defense against forged papers and--
The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Who got himself what?
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
To be sure.  Now tell how your friend died.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
What did you tell him?
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
Good thinking, honey.
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
This is a gift. From me to you.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
Mm.
Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife!
Sure.  Raincheck.
Speak up boy!
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
How'd you find me?
Winston found you.
How the fuck did he find me?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
Uh-huh.
Well, give it to me then.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head.
Get away from her.
Excuse --
What is it?  How does it work?
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Adrian -- you've lost it.
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
George?
Stop it --
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Jesus!
Shu Lien...
Save your strength.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here?  This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning?  I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.
You forgot to say 'Simon says."
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
I have kept it.
They took my daughter.
I know.
I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
Your logic is backward.
The nerve.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
What's the title?
"The Day After Yesterday."
Oh. You mean... today?
Um... yeah but it's more...
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Yeah. Thanks.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
A paper?
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Well...
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Sure.
Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Petty good.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
College?
NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
Hi, Egon.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
My what?
Your cell.  Your room.
Then go fetch.
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
Joe, you know you'll --
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
I don't want to go to Siberia.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Surprise me.
The whole kit and caboodle of 'em are British Intelligence agents. <u>Spies</u>.  Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating.  Just like James Bond.
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
Finish, please!
This is going to give you nightmares.
I like this story.
Good night, Sugar.
I'll never be able to do that.
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
No, that's not it.
No.
Oh.
Just wanted to say good game.
But?
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Thanks.
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
Splendid!
I didn't have my camera with me.
A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
Carl --
Goodbye Arnie.
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
What was the top bid?
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
I wasn't spooked.
Lies.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
Probably Mister Riddle.
He was watching me.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
He can still watch.
That's probably all he can do.
You loser!
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
Thank you for sharing that charming image.
I can't tell you.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Anyday...
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
You're willing to die for this.
It's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
Still working on it.
Elly Kedward?
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
Hi.
Want to buy a bed?
Not much.
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
The picture's dead.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If they're good, they get known.  And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse.  I'm sorry, Viktor.
Not exactly. Just thought I'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute.  You know the next investigation we get into I hope it's got buildings with elevators in them. This one has been nothing but climbing stairs. And when we hit the top oor the folks are usually out.
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
SHIT!
Would you like to talk about it?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
Why should they?
I don't know.
Do you remember the night they said it came?
No. I was sick.
How were you sick?
Something I ate.
Did it hurt?
Yes.
Where?
Down... there.
And what did you do?
I went to my room.
And what happened?
I got sicker.
And then what?
I fell asleep.
In the middle of all the pain?
Yes.
Where did the baby come from?
What baby?
The baby they made up.
From their heads...
Is that where they say it came from... ?
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Where'd it come from before that?
From God.
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
I... I don't understand.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Don't you know?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Then let's talk about something else...
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Agnes...
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Would you like to ask them?
What do you mean?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Anything?
Anything.
Marry you?
That's right.  Will you marry me?
What about you?
Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me.  <u>Now</u>.
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
All right  all right.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
I'm hurrying.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
I am.  With you.
Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
The Queen has consented?
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
I will do my duty, my lord.
God I'm hungry.
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
When I was twenty.
Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
Overruled...
Exception!
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
Chicken!
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
You didn't!  It's tinkerbell.  Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night.  Well come on in, at least!
Your advice!
They didn't offer you the job yet.
I want your feelings about it.
Right now?
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
Look, baby, can we talk about it later?
Not without Jamie.
Look.
Hello..
Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---
That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the line here. If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. Do you understand? Everything you say!
1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
How many?
Two.
I meant Sally.
I meant Sally.
Oh.  You're serious.
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
Oh don't.  Everyone says that.
It was inspirational.
Yeah, we're here.
All I did was kiss the girl.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
I don't want you getting anyone in my place.
I don't know.
Think.
We're not going.
Not going!  Are you out of your mind?!  Wait!
Engine room, what happened?
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
These look quite fresh.
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
I'll prove it!
Uh-huh...
Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
What does he know?
Too much.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
That could be anybody's.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
They stole the phones.
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
They missed the boat.
Thanks.
Glad to help.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
Hello . . .
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
WAS SO!
Who is she?
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Excuse me, my dear.
Suits me.
Lookin' good.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market.
So whoever did this might still be around.
I'm not going.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
Yes, I am.
Dick-weed!
Butt-munch.
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
What are you talking about?
Josh said...
I'm not gay.
It's beginning....
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
Right.  Here!  c-4.
You have too many dogs.
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
You're telling me.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
It was too noisy.
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
Oh, Rosie.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
Shut up, you.
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Try harder.
There was no need to kill her.
Then where is she?
Come on Tanner, think this through.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
That doesn't matter now.
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
It concerns his future!
Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.
Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?
I saw it, too.
There are complications.
The hell you are.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
You're too small to be Bogart.
I'm not too short to be Cagney.
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Why are you so hostile?
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
It's not opinion.
You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
I ain't in a hurry.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
What <i>is</i> that one?
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Oh I see --  Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.
That man is your father?!?
Epps, over.
Either of you seen Dodge?
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
Where was the girl?
What?  What?
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
I was going to tell him.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
But... I love him.  I do...
Doesn't matter.
C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Murdered?
Right here in Manhattan.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
Where then?
He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
Straight.
Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
You should work for yourself.
Gotta go.
How come?
Job.
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?
What'd you do?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
I guess he got the message...
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
No, no, I wasn't trying.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No. Life is too short.
No, I'm not worried.
Good.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Sure.
No, I mean, no one.
Hey, you know me.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
Yeah.
Uh, last night...
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
No, no.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
No.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Oh, and guess who showed up.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
I know, man.
You know?
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
What, they're looking for her?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Y- s-sure it did.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Wait. Hey, man.
Erica is in the van back there.
What?
Look.
Hey, man.
She's in the van.
What she doin' in the van, man?
Buff...
What?
She's dead.
She's dead?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Tim...
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Bullshit.
No, no, no.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Yeah, man.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
It's bullshit. Look! Look!
Loretta.
Where'd Johnny find you?
He knew my husband who died.
How'd he die?
Bus hit him.
Fast.
Instantaneous.
When you get engaged?
Yesterday.
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
Turn that thing off.
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
Okay.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
Okay, okay.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
I don't need one.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
No, you don't.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
It'll never work.
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Since when did that matter?
Let's not start that again.
My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?
I can't find it.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I lost it. I lose everything.
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
I don't believe you.
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
Twelve years.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
So?
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
You'll see.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
Want a lesson?
You're an animal.
That's true. What are you?
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
I see a car.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
What you say?
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Is that not enough?
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
Giff - shuttup.    you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
What about him?
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
Twenty-two years ago.
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
The truth shall make you free.
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
Only on the football field.
Yes you are.
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
That's because --
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Oh, no.
Well, who are you, then?
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
Angel, Second Class.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
No no no no no.
Why not?
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
No.
Poly-what?
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
Female.
At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
What about him?
Let him watch.  I want him to know what he's missing.
No, it was the perfect level.
Thanks. Oh, did I tell you. I picked up that new KC and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended. You were right, it is good.
It's not even a mile.
We should have driven.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Whoa.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
So you're going to stop acting?
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Uh-huh.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
If that's what feels right.
It does. Feels right.
Then it's a good thing.
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
Where's Applejack?
He's stuck between two floors.
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
That's right.
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
Go???
You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
What time is it?
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Alex?
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
What are you going to see?
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Do you have bad dreams, too?
Some, everyone does.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Bambi?
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
I have to.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
Just coffee.
You sure you don't want something stiffer?
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.
Whose toe was it, Walter?
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
The nail polish, Walter.
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
But Walter--
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
What about the toe?
FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
That would definitely explain it.
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
No.
Crazy fucker.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
What about Don?
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Whatever you say, sir.
I'll say.
See you around, girls.
Why she kills children.
I'm Clayton.
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Keep trying.
No thanks, Carl.
Monsieur Rick!
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
Nahhh...
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
About me?
Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
I don't think so.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
I don't think he intends to go that far.
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
In love?
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
But you haven't written your novel.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend.  What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Runic?
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
How much beer?
Many beers.
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
You just stand here one minute...
There's people up here!
Get it out of here!
Take it!
That fool. That damn fool.
Oh mah baby Luke.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
Should I bring him in.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
Yes.
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
Come on...
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
What?
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
Yes way.
You better get on back, Miss.
Let's be democratic.
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
What are you talking about?
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
No!  What do you want!!
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
That again.
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
Kill him.
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
Why?  Is he staying?
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
I don't believe that.
You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
If you want to see us you must come later.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
But you can't...
How 'bout you?
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
But ain't no reason--
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
Sure. Why not?
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
Its core?
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Well what you reading it for?
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Foley's got it.
Where the fuck is Foley?
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
We're liable to win if we keep this up. For somebody like you, you sure run fast.
I'll get it! Where is it?
He'll come around.
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
We what?
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
More bullets in the gun?
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
Nick... NICK!!! It's the only chance we've got!
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
My mother.
That's sweet.  That's real sweet.

A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
You're late.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
Real charmer.
I'll take you down there.
All right.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
Really?  Dont get too attached.
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
Hurry, Neo.
Yes?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Of course.
Good.
But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
You can't.
There must be some way.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Which one are you?
Whitefoot, of course.
Come here.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Is that what you think?
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
We need to talk.
I'm late for surgery.
It's important.
So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
I'm very sorry.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
I know. I know.
I know that girl!
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
They help me understand why we fight.
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
Oh, please.
I don't know.
I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
What's wrong honey.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Don't feel that way, honey.
Then why are you listening to her -
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
You have to what?
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
Right here.
It'll have to wait. Come on.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
"We're" not over-reacting.
Could you watch Jango?
No.
I can't take him to work.
"The Strawberries"?
The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to --
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
Tom...
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
Is it safe?
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
I married into it.
He ain't offerin me shit.
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
Thank you.
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
...owe you.
Us.  Owe us. 
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
What happens then?
We found one.
Home it is.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
It's been months. It's not like him.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
So have I
I should go. I should leave today.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
I love you...
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Go ahead. Stun me.
I'm wery sorry, but --
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
You threw them out!
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
Where's Tyler?
The first rule of Project --
Right, right.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
Is it--?
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
Alert seventy-fifth rangers.  Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office.
What happened?
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
An hour, two at most.
Fine.
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
That's good.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
I just might.
I'd be glad to help.  For $50 an hour.
No.
Crayons?
This is a real piece of shit.
Tell me what you really think.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
What does?
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
What is?
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
--Well, maybe that means you.
Maybe what mea--
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
And yours.
He can't find Organa Major.
Luck.
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow!
You're such an asshole.
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
We can't... we keep our money there!
What team?
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
What wockers?
The wockers with the knockers.
Wockers with the knockers???
Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
Really, that's a long time.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Yikes.
Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
The little Brenner girl.
Lois!
It's Alice, ain't it?
No, it's Lois!
It's Alice.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
You're really pissing me off.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
Poor bastard.
The engines!
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
Pulse?
Huntington Beach, California.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Nguyen is good boy.
Watching TV.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Research.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
Wait and see.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
I gotta stay up, Max.
Jennifer --
Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
Huh?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
Right.
Don't you have children?
Matter of fact I did have a kid once.  But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
They do? Oh no...
No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
I'd like that.
So what.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
What d'you mean, any happier?
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
You have someplace to be?
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
The mother.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
What are your rates?
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
Then after that?
He is?
Yes.
He is.
He is.
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
Put the girl on.
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
No Jeffrey!!
Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
I told you, I knew your sister.
You killed that cop Dutton.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
I'll try.
You know.
I know, no--  I know.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.
Oh yeah. Take a look.
Yes?
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Mm...  Oh, man...

What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
Really? They were..
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
I ... don't know. I ...
Why me?
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Last word freak.
What... Powwow...
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
I don't steal any --
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Preparation for what?
For entering the afterlife.
Annie made them.
Who's Annie?
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
I don't like cake.
It's for the party, Dad --
Oh, the goddam party --
'Goddam party'!
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
We like to think so, yeah.
And you don't deal drugs?
Scotty!
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
They smell.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
The what?
The Cretaceous.
Anything else, you old fossil?
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
Oh my God!
It's a Twinkie, boss.
What?
Do you sing and dance?
Eh, no.
No.  I thought not.
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
Why?  Because he had you?
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
You didn't marry him for love.
You know... 
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
Who is that... ?
Be kind to your sitter.
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
I...don't know!
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
Please stop -- please!
You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear?
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
Mademoiselle.
Commander.
Sorry, sir.  There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading.
...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u>, and...
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
I'm just talking about the Hats.
The hats.
A beret.
Why a beret?
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
"...the special detachment..." Good!  What is it?
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
I was jaywalking.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
Good for you. You do know something.
You're tough, all right.
You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
So do I.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Consider me ungrateful.
Its I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
Shell get over it.
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnt have done it without you.
They've gotta be joking.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
It's the thought that counts.
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
To M'sieu Laval?
She's the King's cousin.
Then she should be an excellent dancer.
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
What?
Your offense?  Why are you here?
I don't want to talk about it.
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
Not really, no.
No?
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here?
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
Let me go home.
No.
Let me go home.
No.
I'm freezing to death.
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
You can't. Death is God's will!
I resent God's monopoly.
That's blasphemy!
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
No. He had more important work.
There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
I'll take my chances.
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Hello. And goodbye.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
I don't, huh?
That's why it will be so much fun.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
Murray.
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
How is gregor?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Well, where are all of you off to?
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
I mean breakfast.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
Over here!
This is important to me.
Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
Am I?
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
Let's just say he knows who I am.
Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
Go on -- out with you.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Thanks.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
Yeah.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
Yeah.
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
No.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
No, not at all.
I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
I DIDN'T...
Then who did?
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
Do what?
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
I think I gotta go.
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.
And Dieter?
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
Demented.
Nothing you can say will upset me.
He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, "Please. Please, I need to live." It was the "please" that caught my memory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53.
Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
Just hold on, I got the keys.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
I am!   And so are you.  You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause)  Michael, if you don't want -
To get my money.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Tina, it's not like that.
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
I walk out.
You walk right out the door.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us.
It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Why, didn't they say?
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
You want to go back to shuttle work?
It's steady, good benefits.
Why in the h...
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
I'm such a loser.
That's the spirit.
What was you saying?
You might be right.
Why are you smiling so?
The other day....
What for?
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Where you been, anyway?
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
You seem a little hinked-up ...
Not at all ...
Don't you ever stop talking?
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
How is he?
He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Cool Hand Luke.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
It can wait.
No, it can't.  Good night, darling.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
Are you done?
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
I'm sorry but ...
You remember Samuel, my son.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
Shhhh...
'Bootstrap?'
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
That's not true.
I swear, you look just like him.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Funded by whom?
John Hammond.
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
I said the plan was right here.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
He has a point.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
No.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Old values. Buy.
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
I'm sorry...
Why should you be?  My wife is a mental case.  Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies.
I know.
But you could go to jail for it.
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
No.
No what?
No.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
No.
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
Don't . . . George?
Is he dead?
No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
No.  Trust me.
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
And I'm not even pretty.
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
Blow where?
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
How can we?  We're broke.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
But this is so humiliating.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
Me?  After Sugar?
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
What about "60 Minutes."
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?
I was talking about us.  Working together.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
I can't....I can't....
Here. Make it easy on you.
Don't do this to me....
Just give me your hand.
But they...they could still be....
No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
You have everything?
Jill.
Jill.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
And you can? Power it up?
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Well if I don't who will?
They're happy like this.
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
Just open the door.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
You're kidding?
It happens.  This is where you'll be sleeping.
He gets as much as he wants.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
Jimmy?
See you soon.
So they caught up with you, too?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
Defense droids. I'm on it.
Me first!
Forget it, bunghole!
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
To be hanged.
Nobody's named this one yet.
It's my turn!
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
A block of ice.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
What do you see?
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
Who didn't?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
You love me?
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
We have to have a long talk about all this.
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
Hi. How's business?
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
You know everybody, don't you?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Sign up.
Where do I sign?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
What happened to you anyway?
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
I been thinking.
Thinking about what?
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
Thanks, I will.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
Am I not welcome?
Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
Okay, thanks.
No one's perfect, Kate.
And he is living proof.
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
Lock the door.  Lock it
It looks like the furnace.
Let's get outta here.
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Do you understand German?
No, no...oh...excuse me.
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Believe me, we need to.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
No...
Well do something about it.
You don't owe me anything.
Fuck me...
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
Who else?
He's in there...
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
Talk to Nikko...!
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
So how would you put it?
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
Are you saying this is illegal?
Blackheart?
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Jack, don't!
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
Mary -- Jabez --
Coming, Ma.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
Go on.
Right. April 25th.
Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
We're through running from these bastards.
You're going down.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
When are you coming home?
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
Okay.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
Never will again.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Jesus!
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Thats my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
Yes?
I'm needing lunch.
Right away, ma'am!
Is there something we can do?
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
... unless he has a hump.
What's going on?
Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
What are you saying?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Is it that obvious?
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
You're cool.
No.  You say you're cool.
I'm cool.
Missed you too, cousin.
Yes!  I believe I am!
The cartoon?
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
Yeah.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Right.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
Right.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"!
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
But the sword could be in his compound.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
No...
What about it?
Any idea where it is?
Little place called "Williams," why?
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
I know plenty.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
Yes -- sort of...
That's nice.
What?
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
No, MR. Danvers.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
I'd love to.
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
Let's look anyway.
Lord, you're stubborn.
I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
I don't think you're so bad.
Eat lead, coppers.
Yes, sir.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Yes, sir.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
My brother.  Get inside.
-Since you last saw me.
Was that you?
Who did you think?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Yeah.  I just got it.
I can't believe that.
Believe it or not.  It's best for you to pretend that you do.  After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it.  That makes you a party to murder.
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Yes, ma'am !
What about the documents he promised?
He'll give us the documents.  But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go without a whimper.
But why, Claudia?... Why?
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
I will, thanks.
These are transcripts of various radio broadcasts, including Gaitskill's, the one they tried to stop.  You ought to have that ...
These aren't just...
I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
What?
You heard me: leave the table!
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
You're a nice man.
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
What answers?
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
They do not!
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
Hold lunch!
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
It's only one o'clock...Why don't you get another Fudgesicle -- I'll be done soon -- really soon.
I told you...
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
After a ways.
No, I'm look --
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
Could I ask some questions?
Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
Not a prayer.
That a boy.
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but I wonder if - 
How will they know we're coming?
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
Nice work.
There is one problem.
He's real.
Joey -- do it.
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
What's all this for?
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
Oh... it's a game.
A game?
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
What kind of vacation?
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
We provide whatever's lacking.
And if nothing's lacking?
May I make two suggestions... ?
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  Second, you don't have to decide today.  Take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  One day, the game begins.  You either love it or hate it.  Decide then.  We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  That was my sales pitch.
Oh Clayton.
Did I hurt you?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Need some help?
Pray you, undo this button.
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
What time are you gonna pick me up?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
Okay.  I will, too.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I'll see you later.  Be ready.
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
Why me?
I need someone with your kind of background.
My kind of background?
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Five.
Hullooo!
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Just someone from New Hampshire!
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
He came to kill us.
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
You knew he was coming.
No.
I trusted you.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
I didn't know this would happen.
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
Oh, Jesus...
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
But the police --
-- there's no time --
-- we'll explain it --
-- how? --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- forget it --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
Nothing!
You are the same?
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Yes.  Always.
Does it change with me in the room?
It is less.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
We are brothers.
Through a window.
The windows don't open.
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
"Time is money" -- please.
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
What about camping?
What about it?
Do you like it?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
We ought to start camping again, Dad.
Uh-huh.
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
Huh?
They'll cut the power.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
Yeah, sure, what?
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
So what?
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
It's not a guy...
It's a town!
Okay.
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
With whom?
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Address?
On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
That's the Colt .25 -- a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125.
Shhh!
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
So we got a plan?
Do I know you?
Where've you been?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Who won the fight?
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
Yeah.
Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.
No way.
So sue me.
You bet. We'll see you later.
You're always taking time off....
I like to travel....
You can't have water after morphine.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
How's the pain?
How's yours?
I can handle it.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
What Truth?
The truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. And do you know why?  Yes, you know why.  Your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! How long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here.  Except me.
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
What have you done with his body?
Um ...
Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
Yes.
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
Dristan nasal spray.
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Three fifteen.
A.M -- or P.M.?
P.M.
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
I don't know.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
Five minutes...
Two hundred and seventy.
What are you sorry for?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
I want to go home.
You can't.
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
Whattaya mean family?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
Lula tell you she's pregnant?
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
And?
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver.
Based on what?  You never even see him.
Koontz!  I need you guys!
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
No, I need'm now!
Nothing.
I'm cooking you dinner.
You don't have to do that.
I know.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...
Is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists?  You go to your world, Ill stay in mine. So long, Mister.
Where is she?
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
What do you mean?
You're not going to tell me the rest?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
So where are you?
I'm here.
Where's Jake?
McKendrick's men got him.
Is he alive?
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
We'll all go crazy...
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
That's right.
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Why don't you beat off at your house?
I don't have a VCR at my house.
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
It's getting hot in here.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
You couldn't have known --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
You wanted to get the truth.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
You mean the falsely accused?
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
What was it?
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
Correct.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Do I?
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
That's right.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
What position did you occupy?
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
Out of the mouths of babes.
He's insane or drunk or something. Why, if this unfortunate man, Williams, has really been reprieved, I personally am tickled to death. Aren't you, Pete?
Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
Sure.  Where to?
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."
You're crazy!
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
That's not entirely --
Then what? My boobs are too big?
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
Monica.  You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you.
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
Late night.  You?
Were you with Jamie?
Yeah.
You sleeping with her?
Right, Skipper.
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
-- Yes.
Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
Jake...
How careful should I be?
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
Maybe you're going to have to like me.
I thought you said the line was busy?
I tried again and got through.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Then why are you backing up?
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
You think?
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
Keep trying, Sergeant.
I don't really like to drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
What's that?
Will you marry me?
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
This way, miss.
No, let me go.
No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
It's important.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
Sustained.
Man, fuck you!!!
No Fuck you!!!
You can see so many here.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
That's forgotten.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
Yes, I guess I do.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Hi, how are you?
Okay, Sammy.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
I love that dream.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
But he saw you, right?
He said hello.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
Except for that.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
I'd go with the seven.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
How do you guarantee that?
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
Huh. That sounds great.  Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit.  I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy.
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
I'm a dancer.
Really? Ballet?
No. Exotic.
Oh. Sorry.
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Exactly. A dance.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
My apologies, Governor.
Just looking around.
Got in a little accident.
Yeah.
Give me the camera, Joe.
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
You don't look it.
No. Really, I am.
Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy.  And who's he?
The line's over there.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
How is it you're good? You on a list?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
You see a Ricky Slade?
Oh, that phone call...
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
The what?
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Oh... this and that.
What I've been doing?
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Naturally.
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
You going to turn State's?
Fuck you, Ricky.  I ain't going out today.  I'm going home.  I'm going home because nothing's accomplished here...Anyone talks to this guy is...
A little after eleven.
Why did you come by?
I had some papers to pick up.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
I assume his girlfriend.
Goodnight.  Where was she?
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Just that she got away.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
Wait a minute --
I'm sorry.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
Dude, you rock!
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
That's it?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Charlie! Am I dead?
No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
Come again?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Oh, How'd she get back?
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.
Okay. Never argue with a man.
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
Are you okay?
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Yeah...you a witch?
Not yet.  It takes years of practice...
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
And this?
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
What?
I'll come with you.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
You, me and White, huh?
Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
Not eight...
Hi, Artie.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
In a deep freeze.
I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons.  Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
Not yet. That's why I wanted to see you.
What do you want, hun?
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
This better be worth 1t.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Fine, forget it.
Got what?
Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
Something BAD happened here.
You may call your next witness.
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Oh.
Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.
You've made your decision then7
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
Australia.
Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.
Annina Nosei.
Who?
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Uh-huh.
Got her mother's looks.
Her mother's dead.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
My mother's told me all about you.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
Nah. I want to watch this.
Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
Give me a mirror...
Yes.
With a family?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Did they ever find out?
No.
And it's all over now.
Yes.
I'm glad.
Just a little queasy...
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Right.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
I'll keep that in mind.
Give what up?
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
I don't want it.
Pick a card.
As in, they own it?
Something like that...
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
I didn't know that you spoke French.
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Pinback, throw me the chart log.
Lovebirds.
Fumitsu.
Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Go to hell.
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
Okay, here...  Be a damn fool.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
That building?
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Should I?
Right.
Hmm?
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
Thrusters at station keeping...
Yes?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Italian?
Stop it...
I can't believe you're alone in that house.
No.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
It's safer if we stay together.
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Stay forever.
Damn, I forgot the jam.
Nothin'!
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
No. No.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
Sure.
Yes, of course.
You know how people talk.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Not that I have anything to hide.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
You too, sir.
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
They're not my words. John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Why didn't you come in?
I hate the sight of blood.  You guys don't take prisoners.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
No, I'm not, but --
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
Dad --
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Well ... you were dead.
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
I will never doubt again.
There will never be a need.
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
Who?
Me!
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
You're sure about this?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
What kind of help?
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
I don't know.  But you do.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
Take good care of my son.
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
Why, what's wrong?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
What do you mean?
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
He was caressing.
Phil for God sake.
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
Oh...what's that?
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
I love you, Jez.
I know.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
Remember that.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
How come? The army?
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
Let's do him right here.
Ch...
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
Right.
You can see why it's sensitive?
Uh... Yes.
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
I COME IN HERE - YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM OR WHAT MY LIFE IS AND YOU HAVE THE FUCKING BALLS, THE <u>INDECENCY</u> TO ASK ME A QUESTION ABOUT MY LIFE --
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
...yes, yes, yes....
JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.
I do wish to be baptized.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
Scott, don't say that...
Should I...
No.  You two are the most important things in my life.  I don't ever want to lose you.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
Security consultant.
Where?
Government. Recently retired.
Where in government?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
Where?
The C.I.A.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
Crash, shut the door.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
Rusty's dead. That's Ajax
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
You got my word on it.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
Any time.
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
How much can you bench?
I don't know.
I know.
Then why have you come?
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
So you were unhappy?
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
Oh...
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
Look, look, just get off my property.
The Master is waiting for you.
I didn't say anything.
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Died there?  How?
How the hell should I know?
Come up here a minute.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
I'm telling you!
What's that?
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Claire...
Why did he kill himself?
God....damn you, Rhodes!
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
No wonder they're so....hungry.
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
I won't say anything.
I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
Five times.
I had it at four.
This makes five.
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
Pass.
You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter.
What if our guys open up, sir?
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
Have it your way, Captain.
You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
Well, I'm in school and --
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Yes!
Martin, look at me.
I'm looking at you.
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
That's a nice name for what you need...
Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
Because I don't have time.
Why not?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
And how do you know that?
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
You didn't ask.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
I don't want them now.
I'll not denounce you.
I know.
So --
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
And now?
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
You don't remember?
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
What about him?
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Mom?
Yeah?
Maybe they should put me down too.
What?
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
I'll make it.  I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right?  Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink.  Voila!
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
I think I busted my leg.
Can you climb back up.
What does that mean?
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
I want to watch.
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
Should we get a what?
points at the motel.
Oh.
Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
I don't smoke.
I just wanted to say hello.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
What about us?
There is no us, remember?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
Stop it.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Because I know you're full of shit.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
Yes.
Fine.  Now we're going to make a new rule.  Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing,
I'm worried about you, Robert.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
Depends on what you're seeing.
This is pathetic.
I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  Your ass is goin' to jail!
Yeah I can't.
Why?
I have work, I can't leave.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
I'm sorry.
An eternal damnation.
When?
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
He knows where she lives?
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
You don't say!
No.
No.
Are you scared?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Mind your own business, Peaches.
Sorry, Homer...
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
I don't think you're getting in the spirit of things, Janet. We'll buy whatever studies we need --
That a new Datsun?
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
A soap?
A daytime soap opera.
And?
I was too old.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Somebody's mother.
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
Bledso
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
He still living?
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
You've heard this story before?
So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
The play? All right, I guess...
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Twentyish. It isn't important.
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
How do you mean?
Don't be evasive.
Margo, you haven't got any age.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
Give it to me.
As in, the vegetable?
Do I want to be crunched?
By Guy?
MMMMmmmmm!
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
C'mon, man...
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
How much is it?
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
How much was it?
Forty-six.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.
Great. On my fucking room.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Oh really. Why's that?
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
That's it.
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
If I had known --
-- then we never would have met.
That's enough now!
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes.
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
Just relax, please relax!
What about, tonight?
That, and... I'll be done in a minute.
... I was right about what?
... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Looks like a hacker wrote it.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
'Tis but a scratch.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
No, it isn't.
Well, what's that then?
I've had worse.
You're a liar.
Come on you pansy!
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
Uh... not really.
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
Who are you?
I'm a lawyer.
You can't come here.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
No.
Please.
And why haven't they left each other?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
Yes.
It was not my intent --
Right....
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Hold that thought.
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
About the conspiracy?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
I want to know where Scully is.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
What about the intro?
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
V.P.L.?
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
There are no twos, Max.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
M'hm.
And... uh-
How do you like this couple, Max?
Daddy's dead.
Noooo!
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
Aah!
Yes!
Shit. Bull. Shit.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be!
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Saavik... Is... David with you?
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
No names, this is an open line!
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
Get off the radio!
Now, look...
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Remember Daniel Grant?  Do they say, "without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer/Grant Publishing?"  He's gone sailing, Alan.  He's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are.
We have to find Kittle.
Home, I'm done.
What about the confession?
Need we go through it all again?
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
I'm fine.
Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years.
Of course not.
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
Yes, that would be nice - I'll call round some time...
I know you did.
I knew you'd know.
I know you knew I'd know.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
Of course.
Tough guy, huh?
Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
Sure, but...
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
And you'll be here to catch him, right?
'Predate it.
How fresh is this coffee?
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
Even as a boy I thought so.
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
Where's his father?
Good luck, Mal.
Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?
The witness is excused; take him out.
I'm just looking, thanks.
Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
His father's dead, right?
Hello.
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
His mother?
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
And you have him?
We lost him.
What do you mean?
I think you know what I mean.
No, I really don't.
I think you do.
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Okay--
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
You serious?
That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
Uh huh.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
It is tomorrow.
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
France.
How long is the voyage?
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
Me?  Of course.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Ha!
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Killer!
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
I guess it could be worse. You could be comin' back in a body bag.
I guess so.
Besides I can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.
And let my cry come unto thee.
Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
She understands.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
You're not stupid.
I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
Anything for a dear friend.
But I just met you.
But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Anything else?
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
He's come and gone.
I begged him to let me put that on!
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
Yes.
How do you do.
How do you do.
I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
Why didn't someone tell me!
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
I don't know.
How bad off is he?
I can look and see.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
Well... I don't think that'd work.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
It's my name too.
Right.
Are you and Larry happy?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
All the time...
Well, you are.
And this innocent child.
Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
Shh!
Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Hello...
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
Do you know he won't expel him?
No. But I don't think that matters.
That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
Jeffrey!
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
Thanks.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Unfortunately.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
Go on.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
Morning.
So? How'd it go last night?
With who?
Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
What for?
Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail. She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed. Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin' me, keeps askin' me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station.
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
What ?
You took an awful big risk back there.
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
Suzie Toller is missing.
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
We've got powder but no ball!
Then use rocks!
...It's on.
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
What did it do to you?
Look...
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
I think I burned my gun hand!
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
Why wasn't I insulted?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
Then I demand an apology!
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
She did.
What did you say to her?
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
Go ahead.
I had a dream about this place.
Oh boy.
You see what I mean...
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.
Thanks for helping.
Not at all.
Why are you?
I like it when they wake up.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
And I like you.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
So you take their best...
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
You took her because she helped me.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Yeah...
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
I said I have to do something.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Is within himself.
Many, many days and nights...
Of course, dear. You're home now.
I'm home now.
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
Six one.
He's too tall.
That really you, Red?
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
Your behind?
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
Did you bring the pie and punch?
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
You described the exact contents of my purse.
I just took a shot at it.
Don't pay any attention to her.
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Now you keep out of this!
Attic space.
Let's see.  We could turn that into a media room.
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
What'd it say?
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
Tell me now.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
Get me a plane...
Wait, Will...
Get me a plane!
I'll pick you up in...
I won't be here.
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
I know a guy.
Lead the way.
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is?  It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place, I'll show it to you.
Hello.
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
No. I'm new in town.
You working?
Yeah. On the section gang.
There she is!
Up!
Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Well...
We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
Thanks, but it's under control.
Not at all.
I see.
I'm not scared.
That's great.
Do you know why?
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
It's not me, moron.
Oh. Sorry.
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
You mean your NOT going to spring me?
The rifle.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
Easy, Bill.
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
Easy, Bill, easy.
You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
Rheya.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
Sorry.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I am very sorry.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
No. You're not.
I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
Dr. Lecter -
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
You know I can't make that promise.
Goodbye, Clarice...  You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit.
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
You let them do it.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
So you don't have anything concrete?
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
Have you just plain asked him?
I've asked him what's wrong.
And?
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
Don't drive yourself crazy.  It's probably nothing.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Not if you remember my dad.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
Do I?
What's that, then?
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
Been where?
To Old Madrid.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
You see what's hanging on the wall?
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Huh?
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Well, okay, it's -
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Yeah, you already said that.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
Okay.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Yah.
He saved our lives.
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
What's all that wood?
Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get outporters or no porters!
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
I'M NOT NICK!
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
OH MY GOD!
You mean Alex.
I mean Lauren.
And how would you describe him?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
Seemed...on edge.
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
Just me.
This has nothing to do with him.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
How much time do you have?
What is wrong with you?
How much time do you have?
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
Couple hands. No harm in it.
Sick.  The flu.
I don't believe you.
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
Not me. No way.
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
If you say so.
Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for someone.
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
Where are you going vit the light?
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
I thought you were tinkering.
I just mean...
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
How do I look?
Aces.
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
I'll bear that in mind.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
I am Joe.
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
That is not my intention.
I won't....
Who, Laddie?
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
It was a dream, Star.
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
That's good.
'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
I seen him.
He's dead, Bill.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Worms was comin' out.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
Oh yeah...
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
What about Jackie?
What about her?
I mean, how did that happen?
Lester, it just happened.
She's nothing but a whore.
No --
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
Coop, where are you...
The containment, Second Containment...
Hold on, Coop...
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Sure.	In a cage.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
No?
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Not so good.
No?
Worse since she talked to him.
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
Assure them that you're being well treated.
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
You do?
Tonight?
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
Quiet!
Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.
No.
Lie down on the bed.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.
Alive?
Frozen.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
I actually got some memory back last night.
How much?
Enough.
Oh now this one is mine...
There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and...
I heard you, Ma.
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
It's Esther.
From the story of Purim.  Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
How often is that?
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Considering what?
What I asked you earlier?
You hear me complaining about that?
Fifty's a nice round number.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
Hi, Dad!
Come here, give me a hug!
Gee, you're home early!
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Sure, Dad.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Stairway, youre wrapped, go to transport.
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
Okay.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
Where did you here that?
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
I have only one concern...
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
You think?
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
All right.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Don't play with me.
It's okay. You need me?
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
Listen--
Yes.
Show me, please.
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
Eh, there's only three of them.
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
She's your sister?
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
I can keep the beat.
What do we need another Shill for?
Breasts.
Thank you.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
I see.
Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
Is that a fact?
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
Fire insurance!
Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
Save it, I already took the tour.
You are a lucky man.  Where you come from a man can stand out.  It's expected.  Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
Who's Watts?
Fuck procedure.
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
Yeah.
Then c'mere. I got something for you.
They were in a car accident.
But everybody is all right.
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar ...
What!?
You ever think about dying?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Are we here?
Yes.
This is Dorsia?
Yes, dear.
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
What's he got that I haven't got?
Well, he has a straw hat--
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
--And he has sex appeal.
So what?
Get that out of your trunk.
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
Ha!!
But ... I called Central Services.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
What?
Pretty much so.
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
Yes, Lord.
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
Good idea, O Lord!
Course it's a good idea.
And why do you tell us this only now?
I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it...
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
I know, but that was before.
Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
I have money --
I got money.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Just tell me where she is.
What?
Um-hum ...
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
Just a second.
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
Wait God-dammit!
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
You ought to know why. Because
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
 
Can't say that I do.
Neither do I.  But my children, they're still young.  Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas?  His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  That was Black Peter's job.  He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  That was a warning.  If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again.
Get him alone for the summer. Out in the wilderness. Underneath the stars...
No one? Then why is Zero here?
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Kimberly!
Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
Come in.
Sean...
Me too.
I don't know.
The hell you don't.
Five million?
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
Christmas... Eve...
You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is.  We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how.
No, sir.
Then why bother me with this nonsense? Get in touch with the base commander.
When the lock is broken -- yes.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
No water -- What a place!
All you have to do is phone for it.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
Just past Boise City.
Idaho?
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
I always wanted to see New Mexico.
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.
That's what I thought he said.
We definitely had a moment or two.
Goddamit...
We're pushing oxygen today.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
You may learn to like it.
Wit-tay.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Hey, wait a minute...
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Just a car.
Twelve
Midnight?
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.
It's all right.  It's not hurting...
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
You and the Colonel go back.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
I want to speak with my daughter!
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
I need your truck.

No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
...and a shitload of ice.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
...-tana.
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
...ya?
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
For cryin' out loud.
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
I need your help.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
...truck.
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
...-er.
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
And if that Elvis shit...
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
Peace.
All right.

Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
You want cash?
You want cash?
I got, like, uh....
I got, uh....
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
No.
All right, then how about this?
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
...doing?!
I need your truck!
You are not takin' my truck!
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
I've seen a few.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Okay honey.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Aye.  You have a point there.
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
I... I need a drink of water.
Go ahead, son.
You're still a little... disoriented.
Observe.
They already know we're here.
No thank you.
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
That's right?
Eh...?
That's right?
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
...that's right...
Eh?
No.  That's absolutely right.
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
...that's right...
...cower in his boots...
What is it, Smith?
I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
I had to.
Thanks.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
I hope you're well.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
Are you all right?
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
...yeah?
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
Spock?
And if he's not?
Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
A little?
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
I know. We miss you too.
Good night.
Night.
Hello, Joe.
How did it go at the bank?
How do you know all this?
Not lately.
Anything... just ask.
What is your name?
...I don't feel heat from the name.
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
How different?
Toffs' game there. But not at home.     .
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
Of course I haven't got a nose.
She knows how to take care of herself.
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
David?
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
I already got everything I need from you.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Really.
I'm afraid not.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
Guilty.
On the deck of the Yankee, the night you asked me to marry you.  We weren't much older than they are.
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Detective...
Carter.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
Me?
You just said everyone needs something.
I've got everything I need.
Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all.
What?
Don't belong?
Do you always have to repeat?
Sorry. 
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
You think people hate you.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Didn't want you.
I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?
I can't wait to see the pictures.
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging - waiting  I feel as if I'd never known her.
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life  that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
Weren't you afraid?
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact - I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her  to see her  to touch her  in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
You follow.
We'll think of something.
Oh?
You saved my life.
I'm a Christian.
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Mr. Jameson--
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Mr. Jameson--
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Can I get a word in edgewise?
No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
You think he's..?
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
Not according to the men in blue.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
You know my work?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
I don't either, but it sure sells books.
I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
Jeffrey...
Okay.
Anything you can tell me?
The criminals are winning.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Why do you do it?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Yeah. I get it.
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
Thank you, no.
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
It's your mistake.
The big job.
There is no big job.
Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.
Heh heh. Thank God.
Honey this is Father Dyer.
Hi Father.
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
Yes, it is.
Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.
So's the video camera.
At least she's alive.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
Holy shit!
Agent Lowry?
Mr. Lime - yes.
You remember me? Upstairs...
Yes, yes, I remember you.
Hello Marge!
Tom.
Piter.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
Sure. I love Venice.
I have to go to Venice.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
And Rome.
Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
I guess it's possible.
So, what does the Russki want?
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
'Dim-shits'?
Glenn talked you out of it.
Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but... He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend didn't really love me.
Fuck you.
This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now.
I bet I would.
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
Okay.
Wait 'til I'm across!
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
You could have a great beach house for that.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
I gather you're a decorator.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Where is it?
Upper West Side.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
You should try Adderall.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
I heard that was you.
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
Eh, fine.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
She seemed yare to me.
It's not a bad life, Jake....
You're afraid of the competition out there....
Let him wait.
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
Okay Dude.  Have it your way.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
I surrender...
I'll always go back to that church.
So one day we'll meet.
I found that out.
We learn from life.
That's why I'm here.
Coming with me will be a delicate matter. We will work it out. But Charlie...
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
Where have you been?
I'm here.  That's all that counts. Watch... you'll enjoy this... it's like magic...
Never.
What?
I beeped you over two hours ago.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
I think they make you look sexy.
Options?
Eject the core.
Close only by virtue of antithesis.
George is a fucking burnout case. I didn't want him on the stand anyway. Get more names from Billy.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
No.  It's nice and cozy.
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
Interesting.
Anything wrong?
No, no.
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
That's ridiculous.
And your head is hot.
That's ridiculous.
And you've got cold feet.
Isn't that ridiculous?
Let me warm them a little.  There - isn't that better?
She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
At a press conference.
What?
That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts `em right out there.
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Frankly, no.
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Haven't got a thing.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Nowhere.
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
I'll float you.
...what am I going to do all month...
Were the leads insured?
It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.
What does this mean?  What does it --
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
P.A. What the hell is that?
Potential assaultive.
Anything you need.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
That's it?
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
And I can go free?
Go, fo' I change my mind.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!
Yes you did.
Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
That's great.
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
You're a liar!
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Great!
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
What more proof do you need?
Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.
Well -- come on.
What the hell is this?
The freeway.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Not me. But other people seem to.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
They can come to the concert in the park.
I said 'no!'
You've misunderstood.
I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'
Move!
Ah well. Eh, look!
Hi, Jennifer.
Who drove the ice cream...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Who put the big hurt on...
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
You, Arlo.
Hello.
You.
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
Us.  Owes us.
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
MACLEOD!
No! Let me try this!
I vote for me.
I vote for the hammock.
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
You're the asshole, buddy.
Get a life.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
I have school.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
Shut-up!
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.
The baby I lost...
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
26th off Wilshire.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
What about it?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Molecular-memory.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
That's the way it was told to me.
This could be it!
Yeah.
Fucking women, man...
I know...
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
You're going to return every cent of it!
I can't! I haven't got it!
What did you do with the rest?
I never had it.
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
He said he was an American agent.
When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
I like it.  Really....
Yeah, I guess so.
Really?
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
Yes down at the station.
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Did you now?  On which bounce?
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
Cheers.  What time is it, Al?
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
Edie, please.
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
I've got patients coming in --
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
You liar!
You've only known Jake a few months.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it.
Yes, Mama.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Yes, Mama.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Not now ... please
No, no, it was great.
How 'bout a back rub?
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
I'll tuck you in.
You can't seduce me.
I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie...
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
It's complicated...
How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
Is my money in there?
Uh-huh. You couldve waited for me inside.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
That's a wolf's head.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
I assume full responsibility.
Okay.
Shall we?
What?!
You heard me.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
Yeah. RISC is good.
Excuse me?
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
I trust you of course I do but --
But?  But what?
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
I know how responsible, caring adults parent children.  I'm bribe 'em.  But 'em a dog or something.  Maybe a Doberman.
I can't help what I think.
This is me.
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Lemme see that.
Fuck him - let him out!
Hello, Katmandu.
My watch is broken, too.
Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
What do you mean, me?
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Out.
Almost?
Yes.  Now, observe....
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
She smiled baby.
That's not cool.
Did she, or did she not smile?
It doesn't matter...
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
For what?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
But you promised.
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
Is LESLIE here?
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
He saved my life you know - has he told you...
Yes.
Good.   I'm good.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
You were spoiled rotten.
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
We were supposed to play golf.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Count me out.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
No, no, I just feel wired!
There's got to be another way out.
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
And what would be your motive?
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
I hate this job.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
Yes, I was in the war.
I can't believe this is happening.
Shit happens.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
You know what?  You're starting to irritate me.
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
That's gonna take a long time!
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Good-bye.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
I did?
You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Hey, let's go spy on them.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
Yeah... thanks.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
Nah.
Then let's get the hell out of here.
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?
Extremely clever.
Meaning you didn't like it.
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
He looks great, just great!
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
Okay, okay.
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays.
It's me?
The one in the street.  I chased after you.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Send them in.
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
I see... interesting...
I... I don't understand.
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
So do I.
Would you hold this for me?
Yeah
Oh, the usual things...
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
What?
I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
She pay you much?
I didn't kill your wife.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
You mean--beyond pacifism?
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
sighs.
Can I go now?
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Mexico.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Barbara.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
No!
China
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
I was wrong.
I've had some experience.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
The same. Look here, Gray --
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
Slut.
Kiss me on the lips.
Give me a break.
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
We'll get a ride in the morning.
Cramps?
None of your business.  God.
This is it.
And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Yeah.
Me too.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Yeah, right here.
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
Let's have a look anyway.
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
What is?
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
Yes.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
No, sir, no response.
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Oh, when'd you quit smoking?
I want my car.
You got the money?
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Altar boys?
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Gee, it's easy.
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
Yeah.
I still am.
I didn't mean to.
Got carried away, huh?
Dr. Evil?
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Whatever happened to Mary?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I mean since then.
I don't know.
Well why don't you look her up?
Yeah, right.
Why not?
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
You're kidding? What did they say?
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.
Should I?
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
Yes.
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
The Big Boy did...?
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Huh.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
Me, too.
Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.  P.S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years.  You like that story?
We don't....
I got her...
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Yah.
Shut the heck up... Pop.
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
No, Dad.
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
You would risk your life for strangers?
Not for strangers; for my country.
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
I know.  I know, Michael.  It's Christmas, your brothers and sister are all here -- we are happy. Let's not spoil this.  Go your own way, but when you are ready, come to me the way a son should.  I have hopes for you...
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
Yeah, like...
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
I believe in you.
Think about it.
Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
Bacon cheeseburgers.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
Trust me.  You don't want to know.
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
I hope so, sir.
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
We've done it before.
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Shag her senseless.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Right in front of the room.
Fine.
I know the feeling...
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
I don't scare that easily.
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
Uh-huh.
Who?
What'd you care?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
Well, thanks.
Ask him yourself.
What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
Four times... so far.
Can anyone else see him?
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
A sign from whom?
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
How does that make you feel?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
Is Callie still around?
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
Do you feel alone right now?
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
Time's up.
What?
Not today!
Charlie -
Yes?
It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
You're wrong.  It does make a difference to you -  Rector's, Brad?  Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent.  You won't miss anything.  It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Open the door. We're late.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
No! Don't tell me!  I don't want to know the future! My knowledge of future events... your mere presence here... could have devastating effects on the course of history. And altering history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear. My immediate response is to send you back to your own time.
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Right.  No one else?
Absolutely not.
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
Personal ads?
What things?
What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
What deal?
Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.
As above, so below.
Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
I know, I know.
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Yeah?
Understand me?
Yeah.
Is there a problem?
That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying.  If he's carrying, he'll step out of line.
Bill!  Bill?!
Patrick, he's...
Okay, okay.  Listen:
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
What do you want to do?
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
Do you mean that?
I mean it.
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Oh, shit.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
At least we found the diamonds.
At least!
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
Tell them yourself!
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
I didn't tell you everything.
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
This room is full of ghosts.
You're lucky, boy.  My house is gonna be filled with people.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
Okay.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
You can see me now.
And you're happy about that?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
I knew where it was.
Oh.  then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective.  You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for.
You betcher ass, General.
What's up?
I've been trying to find you all day.
Here I am.
No... this is the first time for me, too.
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
What are you afraid of? What people think?
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
Fish eyes?
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle. He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver. I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. Splat! It just stuck up there and spread out. It was about the size of a half dollar. And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes.
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
What do you want to do?
I want to be an actor.
Then express yourself, Bob.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
-- my loss --
-- even if I give you a million as well?
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
Now just a minute, sir!  You're way out of line!
So where's Plissken?
No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
What?
You and I -- a relationship.
I was wondering what that was.
Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
Thanks.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Hand me the canula.
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
So what? You going to help me?
WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        Jack... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?...                               
Hold it.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.
No...
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
Really?
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
I thought you were allergic to latex.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
That's all, for now.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
You made the front page.
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
What?
Take a look at this.
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
Yes, sir.
Do I give a shit?
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt  after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
No. That's okay.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Naw. I don't mind.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
...what?
Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
I'm right here, Dad.
You all right?
Yeah, I think so...
Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
MADISON!
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
I can't.  I have too much to do.
Dad?
Yes?
Do you like this hotel?
I do.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Don't do this.
... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me?  To tell me you know what's best?  To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
Damn right.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
No.  I mean your relationship.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
In college. A car accident.
Was it serious?
Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
No.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
That it is.  He shall know your ways as if born to them.
Pride will do.
Hi.
You can't leave, George.
Why not? What's going to stop me?
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
Good, because you've got a new one.
You want me to call the doctor?
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
Oh, that'll be nice.
First, the money.
Who's there?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Yes. We're suing.
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?
Jesus, Teddy.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
I met this girl.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I don't know.
Did you tell Alice?
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
What d'you mean?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
What does that mean?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
I didn't plan this.
Yeah.
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
Okay.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
I don't follow.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
How much?
One way, or round trip?
One way.
30.55. Twenty more will get you back.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
I'm not doing it!
It'll be fine.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
It's already over.
Alan!
Max, I've got a hit series.
Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
Lois, you're amazing.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
...Fred...
No.
What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
How long, Dixie?
Ted, please be careful.
Al!
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Al!!
Where is she? Is she all right?
Deodorant.
Here it comes....
Who grows more beautiful....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
I told you....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
Oh, Jake... 
Happy birthday, darling. ...
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
He's gonna be awright.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Time marches on.
How much you got left?
Three months.
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
It was for personal consumption.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
Delano?
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
You're kidding me.
I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.
Yeah, right, publicist.
Charge it.
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.
What's she doing?
She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
That's unique.
Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
Noon...
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
And all the time you was plannin' on runnin' again.
Master Kong.
Well, we were just...
Like what?
Stop it!
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
I love you so much, Leon.
I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
I don't want you, Steven.
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Go 'head. Do it.
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
The coin _wants_ to decide.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
I wrote that.
No kidding?
It's not done.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
But it's not a year from now, is it?
Is that what's affecting your performance?
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
Yeah.
Alright, let's boot up.
How much.
One way, or round trip?
One way.
Thirty even.
Never heard of him.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
Like you?
Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
Hostage negotiations.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
There's a lot of that going around.
Hi.
Very well, proceed, sir.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
I will do so as soon as possible.
What's the point?
It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
Just be careful.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
Please, we hardly know each other.
Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
What is it?
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
Yes, I can do that.
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
Take it easy.
Marge, when did you get here?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Dickie did it.
Dickie?
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
What?
Get on. I'll take you to him.
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
It's fantastic.  I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
I guess so.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Where, sir?
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
A well-accepted theory.
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!
Twenty-five.
They've got a summer house in Nantucket, with an upstairs polo field.  You better put a canopy over his bunk.
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?
I see.
And you said...
What else?  Keep on keepin' on.
Oh, really?
Bigger and better.
Then how come you're talking to me?
Take off your top.
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
Do tell. Why drug related?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
No shit?
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Nope.
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Who is he?
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
Thank you.
The law. Well the law is a human institution.
I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
I don't care.
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
You're a long way from Whittier.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
A bad idea.
I got us through the War all right.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
That's it.
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
No, don't ask me!
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
Immune from what?
You shall see.
What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
No.  That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
Sure, Mack...
Shields, aye.
May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
What?
There's only one key.
We'll take it!
Come on!
I want a second opinion.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
I'm not asking.
Let's go. Come on.
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
So what?
They're not that Jewish.
I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
I mean... feelings.
Do you have a moment, sir?
Of course, sit down.
She said she'd be here at 10.
She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
This interview's over! The militia stays!
Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?
Yeah.  All over.
Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
When was the last time?
Why?
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
Give it.
Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Against what?
Against anything. Just protest.
You got me.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Yes!
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied
Grab it, Eddie, grab it!
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
Why what?
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
You need me.
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
Noooo, please...
What is your nationality?
I'm a drunkard.
I can try.
You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
"So... surprise"...
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"But you won't..."
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
What kind of an act is this?
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
I guess so.
I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
I don't know yet.
I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
That's my girl.
Oh, but I am!
-- words alone are insufficient.
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Here's a wow.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
You give him his drops?
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
It is for that he hates me.
Your eyes told me.
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
Your weapons, Sergeant.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Great.
You got a better way up?
No thanks Karl.
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
What caused it?
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
Wow.
You know, you're a very attractive girl.
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
Oh.
Coffee.
Zwei zwartze.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Maybe it's better that way.
I read about it in the paper.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
The name's Plissken.
Where've you been?
Never mind that, where are we now.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
Gimme a minute.
Looks like you can have all you want.
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
Cool it, Andy.
I didn't mean it the way it sounded...
We're going to do this.
You have to say that.
That's true.
I'm late.
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
With your gun?...
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
No. No, no, no.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
What? 
A Tab.
Look.
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
And?
And now the job's yours.
I'm serious.
You grow fond of him.  That's good.
Don't play God with me, Aramis I --
Well, go get her.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
He already knew it.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I'm thinking about producing.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Excuse me.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Is that so?
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Look around, sweetheart.
Yes.
I wish I could.
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
Meaning...???
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
And your only goal is...???
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
So that...???
Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Yeah, she's nice.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
You wasn't with her, were you?
Huh?
You wasn't with her?
With her? How?
You know, like bang her or anything?
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
Yeah it was all just an accident.
Yes, sir.
You have a Lieutenant here...
Will you quit moving around?!
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
Yes, darling.
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
Aye.
That's not bad.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
I believe it.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
How do I know that?
Yes.
Do you know what you're going to do?
No.
Are you going to graduate school?
No.
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Oh, do you do much fishing?
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
Which leads us to...
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
Sure I have, but I got rid of it.
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Just a favor for your old man.
Sure, Dad.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
Clark. . . !
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
We know that.
Fine.
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
No, you did fine.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Yes... I... yes.
Jack doesn't need money.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
But not now.
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
Nonsense.  What next?
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency?
You don't understand...
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
What?
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
This rope is sixty years old!
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
Never
Never, what?!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Helluva time for vanity!
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
No.
Tell her to bring it back!
You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
You Hoto?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
Right.
Did your husband know Quaid?
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
You don't?
I think we make our own futures.
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
But-
HARRY!
You're right. Hey, thanks for the jet pack. Your fantasies are so much cooler than mine. Bye Mom.
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
That big guy lookin' for me?
No no, I'm fine, really...
I was so worried -- we've all been looking for you!  The English are everywhere!  O thank you, lord!
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Page boys!
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
It's all right.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Let's just call it square.
Hello, Hal.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
You never were together, Hal.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Clyde.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
Hello.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
We'll see.
Leave the light off.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
These shoes are itchy.
You <u>can't sit</u>!  You gotta walk around, with good posture.  You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll <u>never</u> invest in our movie.
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
That's what I do.
Seen a lot of islands?
Quite a few.
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Anti social?
Self sufficient...
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
Takes one to know one.
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Pleasantville Marathon?
Yeah. Every episode ever.
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
What kind?
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
Put a BOLO out on that.
Rogers Hornsby?!?
He's all yours. I was holding him back.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
Scout's honor.
I'll be your best friend.
There's nothing to explain
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
I will not defend my life to you--
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
There is nothing to discuss-
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
I'm honored.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
You're completely reliable.
What's this?
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
In what way, pray tell?
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
You did?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Maybe it's time you got out.
Me?
You.
Okay.  Okay.
You're an imbecile.
I know you think that.
Everybody thinks that.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
I don't think so.  It could have been.
If what?
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
They were enemies.  We were at war.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Goodbye, Looseleaf.
You have an incredible memory.
Just a waitress.
You underestimate yourself.
Go get your stuff.
...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.
Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
Hurry.
Yeah.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
You ain't dying, he is.
I'll call somebody.
Who?
A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Strategically.
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
Yes.
You alone in there?
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
You've got it!
Hey, you guys back already?
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
What does it say?
It says, "Ray."
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Get out?! What does it say?
"Fucked me."
Aww. Cool. Dude.
Oh no, it's that kid.
This is the place--
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
Where are you?
Food-storage room!
We're coming!
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
Strategic Air Command.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
We are. And it's winding down.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Marylin?
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Dogs?
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
Honest, Spats.  I had nothing to do with it.
I'll get it, Jabez.
Thanks, Mary.
Hello.
Deals?
It's isolated.
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
I wasn't helping you for money.
Sorry.
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
Certainly.  Goodnight.
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
My friend the clitoris told me.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
He talked to you?
I can arrange security.
What about those other guys you live with?
No. I mean back to your home.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
Yeah, well...
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
What?
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Still...you did the right thing.
-- we are?
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
Why?
I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
I'11 meet you in the car.
Tom?
I'll only be a minute.
No fear of that now.
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
Sit down!
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
Just ignore her, Mac.
I see.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success.
That's correct.
How would you like the funds?
American currency.
This will take some time.
I have all day.
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Yah, so we're all set.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
Yah, well, they exist all right.
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Yah, how much money was that?
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
No, no, fax is -
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Okay.
Okay, real good, then.
Fuck!  My money!
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
What about him?
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
You won't live to see it.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
Oh really?
Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
For who?  The fish?
For whoever's in that thing.
-- He won't.
Aw.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
Worked.  Like a charm.
I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
Goodbye.
It could have been marvelous ...
Divine ...
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
But it could have been glorious.
Lovely.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Goodbye ... 
You're an asshole.
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Oh --
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Me?
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
No money, eh?
The money's in my saddlebags over there, but I ain't stepping out to get it.
And cunning.
And what do you do about it?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Pity.
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
Yes.
See you.
Of course.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Me too!
What do you want with him?
I can't.
I know. I'm sorry...
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
That's okay.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
Depends on how good you drive.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
You're welcome.  Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too.  We're very busy here.
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
How many bottles?
Not sure. Ten?
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
Possibly.
Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
Yes, Amy.
But why?
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
Mornin'...
You ready to eat?
I'll wait till after the children.
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
What's it like where you come from?
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
It's good to see you, Kahn.
Where are you, ol' buddy?
 I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you. 
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Doesn't look like it much matters.
It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
Where would you look for the mafia?
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
What were you, following me?
How do you reconcile the two?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
Explain it so I can.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
I don't think you know what you are.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
Who killed Manzetti?
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
Get the fuck away from me.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
I may spill something.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
What's the surprise?
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
When?
We better have a drink first.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
No fair guessing.
My pleasure.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
I'm going to get laid.
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.  No way they could stop it.
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
I don't understand.
Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
How 'bout the key?
I bet she's easy jam.
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[The ransom was ten.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[Don't lie to me!]
[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Do they have drinks?
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
I've had enough...for now.
That's your monkey, Denham.
Kong ...
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
The men said, nine.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
That only leaves three.
Plenty.
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Fire's out, isn't it?
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Okay... I will...
Yeah, pops!
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
You don't look so good.
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
Okay.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
It's because of me.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
A hot shot, huh?
Nah, just working the job.
I hear that.
As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders.
So be it.
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
I will.
He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.
Gross!
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
Then help her.
I am...
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
There's another choice.
What?
Aquittal.
How?
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
I'm all right.
She is here.
Why, yes.
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
All right.  I'll be right back.
Don't.
Who was it?
I don't know.
Yes.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
Let me lay a little theory on you--
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
Right. Nixon didn't get where he got by being dumb--  --listen, that was a Watergate question--
No.
The guy looks dead.
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
Regardless, he still is your father.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
Peerless, last time, go see your father.
Where did you get that?
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
She's a predator.
It's okay. For restaurants.
Yes.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
Oh, so I'm disposable?
Teddy. Your buddy.
Prove it.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
What do you mean "you think so?"
He was a bit proud as I recall.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
He turned out all right.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
This is a remarkable aircraft.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
A dubious distinction, no?
I guess it depends on your perspective.
Mrs. Thorwald.
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
I don't know.  Fuck off!
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
Good!
That's the problem. He did.
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
Why don't you leave him alone?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
I know about what you mean!
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Beautiful all over, eh?
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Huh huh. Jack. Huh huh.
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
And a good thing too.
Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.
A football game?
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
But what about Major Houlihan?
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
As brave as my father. As wise.
It would matter to us.
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Thanks Walter.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Dude--
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Now Dude--
This whole fucking thing--I  could be sitting here with just pee-stains on my rug.
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Yeah.
A little longer for me.
Really?
I want you inside me.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
Whoa!! Nice voice.
Oh, yes.
Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Soon, but first I must bless this house.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Sorry.  It only plays static.
My name is Tom.
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
No.
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
If they knew what they were carrying.
Oh Louis, Louis...
I remember you now.  Shit.
Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.
Oh, me -
How old did you say you were?
I didn't say.
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
I work at Seligman's.
Is that what you want to do?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
We appear to have plenty of time.
Yeah.
The NSA killed him.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
What's going on?
They're here.
Who?
Them.
Where?
Here?
<u>Here</u>?!
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
He did volunteer one time...
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Thomas.
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Damn.
Sometimes.
He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
Fair enough.
I will not talk about the other two.
Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
What are we gonna do up there?
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
Fuck you.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
That's my point.
<u>What's</u> your point.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Why?
Because my life is being ruined.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
Goodness, that's awkward.
Is that what you say to people after death? "Goodness that's awkward..."
Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
Hey, bud.
I don't want you here, Terry.
Sure you do.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Major.  Dish.
Manicure...
Wanna bet?
I just checked myself.  They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there.
And they're changing into...
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What do you mean "complete"?
I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
'...Yes --'
Where's Hap?
He's dead -- good and dead.
Sorry to hear it.
He didn't suffer.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
Any friends?
No.
Ever see her with someone else?
No.
Did she ever mention any friends?
No.  Ask Irene over there.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
I like you.
Do you?
Yeah.  Would you like to come up and have a drink?
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Ain't worth thinking about.
Sadie was not a man!
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
It will?
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Constantly.  No, in all serious- ness, it's really good.  It's fun writing again.  I'm happy here, honest I am.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Hey, can I borrow this?
What? Why?
I promise I'll take good care of it.
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Don't you trust me, Seymour?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
I was never very good at it, remember?
That's my girl.  Done.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
I don't get the distinction.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
I guess.
Interesting.
Well she...
She what?
She's a friend of Jill's.
And who's Jill?
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Don't <u>even</u> talk about that stuff!
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
Unbelievable.
Classic.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
No, Ben.
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
Hm!
Anacott Steel. Buy it.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
...Huh?
You know, on farm route 17.
Oh yes! In Muncie!
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
You don't say.
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
Every year?
Well -- this year -- if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful --
Time out!
Replacement coming in! Harding out!
Whatever.
Yes?
This your place?
Yes.
Lori, move.
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
Don't touch anything.
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
Looks like it's adrift.
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
Just passing through.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
It'll cost you five bucks.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Not a one.
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
It was just a thought.
Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
No more revolts.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Well, I don't...
Oh come on. I'll teach you.
What's it to ya?
You must have a girlfriend.
That's none of your business.
Aha!  Is she young?
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
Twenty minutes.
No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Hey the door was open.
Then get out and close it behind you.
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
Get the hell out!
Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
I am a very serious gardener.
I'll take the Mallory.
Good choice.
I don't have one.
Oh.
Dad?
Ten billion to one.
I could use the walk.
Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
Like what?
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Yeah.
Ray, we're just friend.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Why are you being like this?
What's he saying?
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
We don't want to go there.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
He certainly could. About a month.
What are you waiting for? Do something.
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
What?
You can handle this.
A situation easily remedied.
Tie them that they may watch.
I need someone to translate for me.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
And I'm supposed to care?
You could fake it.
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Nursemaid?!
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
We should follow him home.
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
We'll get it later.
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
John don't like him much.
Pearl dotes on him.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
There's something else.
What?
The money, Icey.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
You'll come right out and ask that Man of God!  Mr. Paow-well!  Clear that evil mud out of your soul!
We've been making progress, I see.
You have blood on your pants.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
I won't allow it.
I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
Beth --
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
Beth.
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
Beth --
Yes.
Three times, then two times.
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
So you just want to use me and go?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Sure.
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
You killed them.
What does it say?
You do?
Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the - it's the best thing you can do right now. I mean this. And you'll have real security.  Sweetheart... you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
I don't take those assignments.
What about Juno?
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Did you pork her Harry?
No.  But I wanted to.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
Looks that way.
Mr. Soze will be most -
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
Hi, Nick.
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
Why?
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
Unwell?
I understand he was in a fight.
Has he been hurt?
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big.
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
Here's his head.
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
Claude.
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Strange voices, Rose?
Yes, sir.
Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Full power, sir.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Because he's out of shape.
It's NOT too late!
Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
They say I am no good to you.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
Sal!... fourteen street.
Come on.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Yeah...just had it delivered...
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
What?
Remember that day?
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Thanks, honey.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
You're fast.
That is our job.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Get your people out of there or I will.
The Chinese.
Yes.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
Do you know where she might be?
Certainly not!
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
Nods.
Let' s do it.
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Move? Where to?
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
The third floor are low class rooms.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
Well, I hope it stays that way.
I don't fool around with you.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
..or hard wired..
- or hard wired, right.  First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I'd say.
Who would do that?
Bob.
But Bob isn't real.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Maybe.
Bob is real. He's been "having" me since I was 12.
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
We work in the dark. We do what we can.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
Oh, come here.
To who?
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
You're there now?
Oui.
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
No.
You're calling me on is phone?
Oui.
My number's going to show up on his bill!
Should I call you back?
Good night daddy.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
What job?
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
No. I thought about this, Mr.
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
Inland.
Santa Rosa?
Maybe.
I was desperate. It was gross.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
He says he loves me.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
No!
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend.
Please, the children.
Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
Come up and see me... now.
It's very late.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
You're crazy --
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
Get your hands away from the desk!
So I can go.
Sure.  Looking good.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
I think I know how to have a spice rack.
That isn't necessary.
He's bluffing...
I understand, but Annie, please...
- See, what you can do for him --...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
It isn't right to make him suffer...
And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please.
I am not.
Oh, yes you are.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
What are you doin' in there?
Who's this?
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
I'm training to....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Well, we've got something in common then.
Frances...
Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
Survive today, that's the point.
Fuck you.
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
She looks like a freak.
Then get them out of there.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
Then you're perfect.  Here's your radioactive sample. Study it.
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
I know I can bench more than that!
Just listen.
I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
I'll never tell.
Twenty-eight years.
Get out of our way.
So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan?
... and you knew about this.
Energy shielding positive function.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Armed.
No?
No. It was an accident.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Right.
Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--
Yeah.
Plenty of pep, too.
Uh-huh.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
That sounds good.
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
Christ! You do know it all!
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
You got the wrong man.
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
You killed him?
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
I'm sure you have
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
So how ...?
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
What has Tuttle done?
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
He's a freelance subversive?
He's a compulsive heating engineer. A maverick ex-Central Service repair man with a grudge against society. Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood, I think. At least we will be when I get this Layton woman under arrest.
What's that?
A padlock.
I have.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
No.  I haven't done it in years.
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
I was in his cabin--
What!--are you crazy?
I'll explain later--
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
All of you!
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
Plus a bonus.
What bonus?
The American? Yes, duck.
How did he look?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
Thank you.
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
We had a seance.
Who did?
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
How did you--
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
Okay, I guess.
Here we are.
What is he doing here?
Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Nick. It's okay... It's okay.  I have to go now.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Aren't you late?
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
Tell me about it.
He was just doing his job.
So was I.
Did you say, "I do"?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
He's a selfish bastard.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preacher got to *know*.  I don't. I got to *ask*.
What do you mean?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
What?
Did you know that?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Sit down, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
No.
What?
My husband will be back quite late.
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
Yeah. It's really good.
Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
I don't know ...
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
End...?
This has to end.
For what?
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
No.
In case <u>who</u> checks?
No!
My--uh...
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
You ought to get rid of those dogs.
Well.... er...
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
Whose fault was that?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
What guy?
Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.
We play tennis at the club.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Yes.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
That's Babar.
Two bs?
One. B-a-b-a-r.
That's two.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
I don't know. I don't have any.
No children?
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
Thanks.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
Yes, Sire.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Who told you this, Majesty?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
I knew it. I told him.
Now what?
We just don't stop.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
A speech impediment?
You're not a pain in the ass....
Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.
Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
Yes?
I think you found something.
Gallon or two?
Well, looks like we done it this time awright!
Only what's right...
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
You ask what the point is?
That's right.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
But not too ashamed.
Now you are being rude.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
Ouch.
Don?. Where is he?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
The body?
Have you any money?
I have a little.
I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
How did you know my name was Sarah?
You told me.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Okay. So what's your name today?
Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you.
What?
I think I can handle that one.
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?
No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
Hang...out?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
He had a yacht?
No, he just hung out there.
And where did he go to school?
What?
Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you.
Where are we going to sleep?
The family room.
If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
Yeah.
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
They done that too long in my family.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
Are you sure?
It's fine really, sit.
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
Oh no?  How about this one?
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
Casy, won't you say a few words?
Eject the core.
Quite.
I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delben. Mine is a higher mission.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
No.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
That was our apartment.
Have you been there recently?
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Why not mine the damned walls?
We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
Off with his head!
Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
Yeah.  She told me.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
I heard.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
You?
For calling you a homo.
That was out of line.
Seven.
And what do you see?
Somethin's in my room.
What is it?
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
Say what?
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
The hell you talking about? What train?
We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
You found us okay?
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
We haven't checked.
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
I guess so. Then what happened?
Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.
Nope.
No...  No doctor...
What makes you think so?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Yes.
Huh. And why is that?
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
Maude, do you think you can help me?
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
To kill the king.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
Okay. I'm listening.
Away team. Transporter room four.
Just ... uh ... you know.
Of course.
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
What was this one?
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
We're gonna be okay, man...
Gimme.
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
It's probably not a good idea.
Louise.
Give me the clipboard.
Not really.
Hey!
Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
It's okay.
... You married?
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Lex is going bye-bye.
Sure.
Yes.
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?
My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
Yeah...
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
She didn't.  She just left.
Why do you think she left you?
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
Yes, Madame.
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Practice driving, Tommy.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
Oh no.
It's not what I heard.
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
This isn't happening.
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
Aren't you coming back with me?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
...That's not what I meant.
Yeah.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Let's go.
Who's there?
I cannot believe this.
Delia will cook...
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
May I ask why...?
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
I can't believe...
Stressed.
Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
It's always locked.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
He's dead, you know.
Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
Oh Jesus...
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Okay, cool.
I'll try to drop by later.
Don't want to film this?
Who's up for a night on the town.
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one  I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
I do. I'm -- are you...?
I... I think I am...
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
I don't know what I'm doing.
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
And be poisoned out here in the open?
Certainly not!
It's not what you think, Jake.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
And how long are you here for?
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
Oh. How old?
About a year and a half.
No, your kids.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Must be nice having kids.
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
You're kidding.
I don't know -- am I?
The leads are assigned randomly...
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
Then put me on the board.
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
I can't do it, Shel.
What you mean?
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
You been acrost?
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
What?
We can't do this.
We've already done this.
No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
Wanna another beer?
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
What is it?
Why are you so interested?
Sorry.
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
That's great.
What?
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them.
Just taking your photo.
I look terrible.
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
Happy to see you looking so good.
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
They're losing one mother.  They can't lose two.
Twenty on my man...
You're giving away your money, fool...
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
We did not.
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
Don't look like there's a right way.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
It ain't in me.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
I guess I'll rob a bank.
Don't you get smart with me, boy.
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
That sounds great!
Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
What kind of school?
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see.
What are you doing?
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
Like what?
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
What do you know about hypnosis?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
What if he's on the level?
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Tell everybody hey.
You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
Really, Eve? Why?
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Why not?
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
Where do we come in?
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Possibly.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Candidate for what?
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
-- there's not much room --
That's fine --
What?
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
I'm fine.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
I go running down there.
In the middle of the night?
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
Oh, look at this. Champagne!
Two. Shaken not stirred.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
I'm sorry to hear that.
Cognac?
I should be checking on the boat.
The war will still be here tomorrow.
Is he the only one?
What do you think?
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
... We must try to communicate with them.
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
What's the matter with you, Spooky, my most trusted comrade?  We are warriors!  These are the challenges we live for!
No
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
It always is.
You talking to me?
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
What'cha reading?
The Fountainhead.
Great book.
You've read The Fountainhead?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
Romantic? He rapes her.
That's a matter of opinion.
You need help.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
At this hour? I don't think so.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
Please.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
Thank you.
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
We only have eight officers on duty, Chief.
Who is that?
A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
That's it.
Why didn't they say that before you started?
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
What are you going to be then?
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
Im sorry...
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Why, yes.
Well be more careful, please.
I'm just leaving.
But where?
I have to return some videotapes.
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
Newspapers?
No, the typing kind.
Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
There are things you know for sure.
Such as?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
Your wife?
She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
What!
A fin!
She did?
You didn't even find that out?
There was so much going on.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Where did you plant the C-4?!
...And if I guess wrong?
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
We've still got to find the mainframe.
No we don't...
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry.
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind.
What are my orders, sir?
You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl.  Go out and prove it against me!
This psycho can.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in.
But not for anything I did today...
Sidney, I know human nature.  Susie lied to me - she'll see that boy again.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
You buying?
Sure am.
Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
The what?
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
Oh yeah.
It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?
No.
Come with me to California.
What?
I want you to come with me.
How do you know that?
I know. I just do.
Yeah, but how do you know?
I don't know. I just feel it.
And you're sure about that?
Yeah, I'm sure.
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
I can't go out to California.
Why not?
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
Then what are you afraid of?
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
What am I scared of?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
Is that what you think--
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
At least you have a mother.
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
What the fuck am I afraid of?!
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
I'm not honest?
What about your twelve brothers?
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
No, you don't want to hear that.
Yes, I do, Will.
You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
Whass going on here?
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
Both.
Holy sh--
Take who where?  What you smokin'?
Huh?
Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?
Yes!
You're <u>sure</u>???
YES!  JUST DO IT!
Don't be an idiot.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
What do you mean?
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
Meaning what?
You don't shoot squirrels.
I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Dissent?
You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
What??
John has fallen in love with me!
That idiot boarder?
Not for seven more minutes.
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
My name's Johnny Utah!
Who cares!
I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
Where?
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
You wouldn't.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
What's that supposed to mean?
Think about it.
He just tried to save him!
Take them away.
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
Show me.
Where are you going?
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
I think that's for the best.
Good for you.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.
Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
I'm sure he believed every word.
The guys think I'm too smart.
Will?
You could say that.
Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
All night.
Well... who are those guys?
What do they look like?...
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Well, what?
Godammit, George...
Now wait a minute...
Sit down.
But...
I said sit down!
No way....
It's my fault...I have to....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
Jake.
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
Huh?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
Was it twelve o'clock?
Where have you been?
Tell Vito.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
Then tell me.
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
....that's right.
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
I don't <u>think</u> so.
Then what brings you back?
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
...no...
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
...no...
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
...no.
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
Okay. I'll copy it.
Okay, thank you.
Aye, sir.
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Is he related to the witness?
He is, I believe, a brother.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
I don't want to be a martyr.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
That's just a dream, William!
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
LAPD. Open the door.
I'll be around.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Where's the ice cream?  The Hagen- Dazs butter pecan?
Shit!  I forgot.
Your memory is really getting bad.
I just forgot.
Born and bred.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
You're up late.
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
Yes, I know.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
So what?
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
Yes.
Shit! You're in love.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
It was exciting.
But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
It's alright, thank you.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
I beg your pardon?
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Do you feel that way now?
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Do you still feel suicidal?
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car, will you please?
Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Was it okay?
Yeah!
What did you guys think?
Slides go with it.
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
What!
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
What!!?
What?
Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life.  In order to make a responsible decision.  This is going to be very painful for me.  You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent.  Wait.
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
Well...
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
Wait a minute, GordonI
Get out!
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
Eat me.
All prop cars accounted for?
He has to be on foot.  He has the world's most recognizable face.  He can't disappear.
Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Yes.
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
It was Chloe...
What about you?
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
But where are you going to be?
I'll be right here... I promise.
Have some.
Me.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
What is this, Twenty Questions?
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Dark Valdez.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
And he doesn't care about me?
He is only curious to know who you are.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
He loves me, as I love you.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Tender Hegenheim.
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
Yes.
There's no connection between the families.
There has to be.
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
Let me demonstrate some examples.
Yes.  That follows.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
Could it be intelligent?
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
Not yet.
You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors.
I have to talk to you.
You're wasting your breath.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
I could teach you a thing or two now.
Maybe...
Fuck maybe... be there.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Why?
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
No, that's just it. No.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
What is it?
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
Your family ate dripping?
Of course not.  As I said, only poor people --
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
Uh, <u>look</u>....
Look:  Okay.  Okay.  Look:  look you're driving, countryside, so on, you picked her up, she was hitch...
Oh? What?
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
Good. Anything else?
Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
Albert.
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
A woman.
What color hair will she have?
Blonde.
Tell me some other things about her.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
I mean the nature of you.
Yes?
Have you got a moment?
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
Hardly a worry, sir.
Thank you.
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
'cause you stink of booze.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
Tough break.
It wasn't that serious...
Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
Let her go!
Yes... yes.  I think I will...
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
You wanted to know about a cave?
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
How's it goin'?
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?
What did he say?
That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
I do not know what you are referring to.
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
Is that what he told you?
He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
Stop me.
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
Who?
Kurtzweil, we think.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
Now don't that call for an extra!
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
We'll grant that.
What!
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
I used to be married to one.
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Let it go.
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
What do you mean?
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
No kiddin'?
Almost certain.
Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
Same here. You can retire my number.
Not many.
A thing I made.
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
You earned it.
I did not think so.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
I failed to resolve the situation.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
You may ask, Lieutenant.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you lan' no more! An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
You mean after he lost your son.
It was nobody's fault.
But John was with him at the pool?
Yes.
She's alright.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
Camille, she'll be fine.
Seven-thirty.
So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap connivinggood-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done you hear me? glad what I done!
You ratted on us, Terry.
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
I'll go up and take a look at the General - perhaps sit with him.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
Well 
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum!
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
What?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
How about Italy?
Yes.
How about Bari?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Have you ever been to that station?
Yes.
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
Don't you know?
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
No--<u>this</u> is weird.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
If you get it?
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Mmm.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Wonderful!
Your letter came yesterday.
It did?
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was wonderful.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
No, we don't have to say it.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
How can I look at you and say this?
Say what?
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
You mean you've actually begun some?
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
What?  But I saw 'em-
I'm telling you, there isn't a Mark on him.
Way to go, Mom!
Scotty...?
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
You bet I will, Ma.
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
You're a weasel.
Message -- What message?
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
Yep.  Sleep fast.
I'll think about it.
You really will?
Yes.
You get it when I get her.
Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.
So where'd you get in?
Prnceton.
But what did you get on your SATs?
200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird.
What?
A hanger.
And who are you?
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
We're going to be fine.
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
And it worked?
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
Useless distractions.
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
And whom would you call?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Your cell is more than adequate.
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
What's wrong with my life?
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
That's the one about the albatross, right?
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
In the limo!!!
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Sure.
What do you think?
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
I saw the longing in your eye --
-- that was lust --
-- the passion in your heart --
Are you crazy?
Don't worry!
I heard them Morgan.
Five thirty.  Okay.
Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.
Got it.  Good tip.
Bye...
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
I don't understand.
Aye.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
I didn't give 'em the m-
Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a fuck out of me! You want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?!  You didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money, I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
I never heard about that.
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
Farmer.
Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.
Yeah...
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
And we all went through that together?
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
Are you talking to me?
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
Something he said, just before...
He spoke to you?
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
Yeah, I think so.
Lombardo's settlement?
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Not yet.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
I ain't tired yet.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pros.
You could save him, little bird.
I know.
Yes.
HE did. I've seen him.
I understand.
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
Not too quickly.
What?
You're a little too fast.
Can't you understand me?
I understand you perfectly.
Have you got it now?
Cotton Company --
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
...weight into the balance...
The infirmary?...
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
Now...
Yes, sir.
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Are they any agent?
Yes.
Goddamnit!
You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can make it.
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
Such nonsense.
You're cold?
The others?
Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
Yes.
To the foot doctor.
Yes.
No, my lord.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
Yes, my lord.
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
We've gotta go get her !
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Are you okay?
I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
Uh-huh.
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Oh, yeh.
It's me.
Who?
Me.
Francis...?
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
Part of what?
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
It might have.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
I forgot I had it on.
I don't blame him.
"Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other."
Whose?
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Why did she call me?
Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
No, but you might need them when you get back.
Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Yes, sir.
Where are your men now?
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
Sir?
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
A private, sir?
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
But, sir...I...I...
Spit it out, Captain.
Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense.  Sir.
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
What is it?
...Janitor's job.
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
I beg your pardon?
That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
The fuck did you do that for?!
Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  You don't know one thing about me!
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but 
Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...
Yeah, refill'd be great.
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
Mob guy?
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
... Maintenance facility...
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
It's a pleasure.
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
You go to hell.
What?
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
I wish I knew.
His brother.
Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
No.
Please!
Then we must call the police.
No.  I mean...  that isnt necessary.
You will not have it?
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Where'd you leave 'em?
I don't know.
Did you look around the headboard?
Jezzie, I can't see.
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
Gee.  Thanks.
Let it inspire you.  Maybe it will let you think of me.
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record.  Was it you?  Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse?  Why?
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Sorry.
Don't let it happen again.
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
...are they hard to get?
Impossible.
...what a world.
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
Think she means for us to follow?
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
They did it... they assimilated Earth.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
I'm not falling for it.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Get out!
About six and a half million dollars.
The sound again?
Yeah. Security.
Crabs?
No, sir.
Lice?
No, sir.
Through there for a bath.
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
Weird what you remember.
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
Don't mix very well with beer.
Kelly--
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
Backstabber?
No.
Liar?
Myra.
Shitbutt?
I really... I should get back.
Oh, right.  Alright.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
So you'll stay?
Yeah.
Good.
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
Give me the phone.
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
I only live up there and across the roof.
Thanks anyway.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
What for?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
This won't take long.
What?
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Look about last night --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
Stewart!
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
You can't walk out of here like this.
This way's perfect.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
I'm sorry about that.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Ben Schwarz.
Schwarz. Jewish?
German.
Doesn't ring a bell.
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
Could I have that in American?
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
So she did witness it?
Why the hell not?
I don't know.  I'm just not.
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
I'll be okay.
So... did you get a look at heaven?
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
You threatening me?
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
He is not cracking up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What did you ask me?
What?
What is the question you asked me?
I said, what have we done?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
Say it again.
What?
What you just said. Say it again.
I just want to get married.
Exactly! Exactly my point.
"Thunder lizard!"
I know, this is fucking nuts.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Yeah.
It doesn't look like it.
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
So?
So I don't know about horror.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
I'm sure we can match any offer.
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
You.
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
I'm not getting an answer.
Not getting an answer?  For Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's get it locked down here!
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Would you, Sir?
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
Be careful!
I am--It's our only chance.
Nothing is worth your life.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
You do?
Yes I feel it in my bones.
You're talking nonsense.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
I should hope not.  I hate you!
That sudden?
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
...And I thought you loved me.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
But will it--hurt the baby?
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
I thought it was interesting --
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Electra --
A pleasure doing business with you.
I swear that that woman in my room...
This just won't work.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
What is it?
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
Do I need one?
We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
No, tell me.
You Yanks and your therapy. Its great.  Its all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
Frightened.
Do you remember what just happened?
Yes.
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Yes.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
I don't want to look pushy.
You won't look pushy.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
You won't come on too strong.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
I don't know.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Jamie?
No! No! Don't!
When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
Why don't you go check it out?
Fuck no.
I'm just offering a place to stay.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
Fix?
I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.
What?
Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
How's Mom?
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
I can help you out...
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
Theresa.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
What do you mean?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
I see.
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
What business?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Well... I don't recollect.
You don't recollect!
You always stutter?
Yeah, yeah.  Shit, man.  Guy fell on my motherfucking cab.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
No. What? No. I know.
It's more like a date.
It's a long way to go for a date.
Tell me about it.
What?
You heard me.  You two, especially.
Come around to three-three-four...
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
You're back.
It's Monday morning.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
I'm your family.
Basquiat, what did you take?
For what?
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
What choice?
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
Half.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
Well, here it's half.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken.  And your fingers. And if I want them to, your right arm in three or four places.
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
Just who's been laughing at who here?
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
Kayleigh? What happened?
<Me>?
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
That depends.  Where are we?
Here ... near the Anoat system.
What?
Do you have a soul-mate?
Define that.
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
Yeah.
How d'you know what I'm like?
Ross told me.
Really? What did he say?
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
He said that? What else did he say?
Just your age.
Which is what?
Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Here in Buenos Aires.
Don't move me.
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
I didn't rob...
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Don't you want answers?
There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
About what?
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
What for?
Who?
The lawyer?
I remember.
Do you remember what you said?
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
What else is going on?
My pleasure, sir.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Apology accepted.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Colonel will do.
As you wish.
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
How?
There was a mistake.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Will it track back to us?
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
And the Landy woman?
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
Anything else?
Right, then...
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
I see. He does talk loud.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
It must be a high priority situation.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Want one?
Uh... got any cinnamon?
Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
Stop what?
Chet...
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
You don't look very happy to see me.
Should I be ?
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
And why is that?
Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick.
Hold that thought.
I am sorry, Duncan...
Peter, are you okay?
No.  What's wrong with the front?
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
No.
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
What the hell for?
Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.
I was having a nightmare.
Wait?
Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
You said that already.
How many, would you say?
Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
No, I'm not. 
What are your plans in New York?
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I love the symphony.
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
What about the notes?
I'll get you the notes.
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
I know that, Dad, but --
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
Always. Always.
Sean, baby, please....
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
I guess.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
No.  It didn't.
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
I've never seen your place.
Exactly.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
They don't come over here that much.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
All right, all right. We'll go.
When?
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
I'll get him.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
And here are my mother and father.
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
With you.
I. Don't. Dance.
Yes, sir.
Quick drop. In and out.
Where's Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
How so?
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
That it?
That's it.
Precise equipment such as waldos
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
I didn't do that!
You said you were here all day?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid!
Yes.
Can I have your autograph?
What's your name?
Rufus.
Just one question.  Please.
He.  Can't.  Answer.
No-o!
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Okay.  'B-y-e!
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
And tell her what?
Hey, look!
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
Sure.  No problem.
Thanks.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
Uh huh.
Are you one of the players?
Yes.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
When I was very young.
It seems like such a complicated game.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Sounds very violent.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
"Well done," Cactus.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
It could be worse...
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
What -- what's on your mind?
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
That's right.
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
Don't rush me. We have all night.
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
Beautiful place...
Sure is.
Don't start on me today.
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
All of that at once, Baron?
Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
Sure.
What?
Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Anything to drink?
Two Cokes.
Okay. Thanks.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
He's a fool alright but you a bigger fool. Hey, whiteboy, watcha waiting for - dat hole ain't gonna dig itself...
Poor baby.
Bastard.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
Frank --
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
No...
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
But you're only a mud carrier.
I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire.  So we can find our way home.
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
Understand what?
You want something, old man?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You want something?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
You can't do that yourself?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Christ no!
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
I said I was sorry.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
All right, old man.  Christ.
Almost as good as you.
I always win, Jack. One way or another.  Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
Yes, it is.
Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
There's a problem, Lamar.
Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here.
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
What kinda twisted animal.
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
Whatta you mean...
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
What are you talking about?
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
I don't know...  What about the other women?
I'll warn them.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
Why?
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
"No, viejo.  That was Jos Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
So we can close each other's eyes right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.  But, then, nobody makes any money...
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
Sixpack...
How is he?
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Second most common?
Skin cancer.
Eighty third most common.
Pitbull attacks.
You just made that up.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, <u>Dad</u>?
Uh huh.
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
How?
You see that car?
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
We'll just start by impounding the Post property.  Is that your desk?
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
I'll drink to that.
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
But he also wrote --
I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
Mary Clarence!
What?
Well, Sherry's great.  But she can be a little much sometimes.
Then who goes?
We all go. How about it, Keaton?
What guys do.  'Nother order.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
I just don't go in with any expectations.
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
They are robots!
You'll find out - soon enough.
I'm fine, Lamar.
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
The Cowboy??
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
Cynthia...what's going on?
It's been a very strange day.
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
You gotta be kidding?
Will you meet with him?
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
O.K.
You got a dog?
No, I have a cat.
How big?
She's in New York.
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
Let's load 'em.
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
Okay, give me the numbers.
Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Thanks.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
Jesus.
You brave soldier.
...Yeah.
Is it hard to learn?
Not really.
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
Yes, I know.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
What? Assassinate somebody?
No --
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
Okay.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
That's Brazil.
Yeah. Maybe.
Wait here for me, Gummy.
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
What changed?
He did.  Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough  -- and well...
And you came all the way down here to see me?
It's nothing.
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
Tell me about it.
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
Well la de da.
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
You like it?
Oh yeah!
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
Okay.
Yeah?
Yep.  Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
I was going to ask.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Would you say that again?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
I've never heard of it.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
Are you've seen it work cures?
Hundreds.
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
Spider.
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
Oh.  Fine.
I'm working on it.
I guess.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
When he went to work, right.
What about yesterday?
He didn't come home.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
He ain't our daddy!
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
No way.
Lloyd.
What?
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
I don't want to know.
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
What yard? When who-
You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.
The bay doesn't.
How long have they been gathering there?
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
No.  Stick around.
You did?
And what was this?
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
This is "Fly With Us?"
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
That's it.
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
INT. U.S. RESEARCH LABORATORY/STORAGE AREA/FREEZER VAULT - NIGHT.
Dad...
Your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
I think so.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Okay.
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
What do you want me to do?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
He has lots of disks.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Dennis won't let me go to the desk.  He makes me sit on the floor.
Read you.
Home on my strobe.
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
What for?
Fuck you.
Anytime.  Anywhere.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
You, too, sweetie, the best.
What makes you so sure it was one?
I can't be sure.
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
They are much more than that, sir.
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
For killing a dolphin.
... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
Hmm.
Would you like a closer look?
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?
I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Good morning.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
Were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ?  I am sorry. Perhaps we should have dinner tonight to.... discuss your future.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Yes, that's what happened.
I'm not here to bowl.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
I'm looking for somebody.
Thanks.  Your dad called again  something about a job.
Say, Ni...
Ni...
...gger.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger.
'Fuck me hard!'
Fuck me hard!
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Again!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Again!!
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
...You carry firearms.
You want us strapped, don't you?
But I just got here --
You've been here longer than you think.
Skateboard.
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
John
Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
What are you after?
Must one always be after something?
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
What?
Will you smile?
Why?
Just smile.
At what?
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
Why?
Because we are an odd couple.
Then you should go back to your table.
No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
What about the blood?
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
Have you ever done this before?
The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
Keys were in it ...
Well, that defies the point, don't it?
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Alright, no problem.  We gone.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Pray. 
French?
Oui.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
There are more important things than tits.
Really?  If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral.
Hey!  Virgil!  My God!  Morgan!  Hey, Boy!  You look great!  Both of you!
Something must've scared them.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
I hate being lectured.
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
Yeah?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
Yes! Hi.
Am I interrupting anything?
No. I was just... No.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
I would love to come for dinner.
Wonderful. Uh...
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
Oh, sure. Great.
I'll pick you up.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Okay. See you later.
Yeah. See you later.
He wasn't acting?
I don't think he knows how.
When?
Soon.
Next week? The week after?
Early July.
Shut up.  Go on.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
I look forward to the sport.  Take him.
What, do you think I planned it?
Did they have something against me?
Didn't they tell you?
I wanna hear it from you!
... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
This is a police control action..
Intelligence may not be the right word...
Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
You think this is funny?
No.  I think it's ugly.
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
You heard from Reggie?
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
What did he find?
Nothing.
How good's your intelligence?
Very good.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
As far as we know, nothing.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
My next delivery is up that way, so I'll be getting down to it real soon.
This isn't possible...
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
What... what are you saying?
It's okay.  We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
You like baseball?
If God exists?
I think now that he might...
Why?
Because I'm so horny.
God exists because you're horny.
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
Where are we going?
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
Youre mad...
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
Why... I dont know what youre talking about.
You know hed have had him killed, dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Have you finished?
When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it womans intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
The lamp was burning all night in his room.  Caravaggio was there with him.
We need another ten minutes...
The bridge won't wait!
Will you leave me alone...?
You tagging them...?
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
The females have eggs....
We'll pass around cigars....
Like who?
Just a thought --
Ah!
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
Thank you, Sire!
How do you do, sir.
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
Really? You think so?
Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
I know.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
what I mean?
think that's, uh-
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
No, so help me.
it's my first time.
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
Yeah.
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Jesus...
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
It's not hopeless...
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
Hooray for me.
I meant biologically.
That's a crappy thing to say.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
They'll meet you at the top.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!

Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Are we hacking or asking?
Yes. In that order.
And what about you, anything?
Who?
Nuthin'.
I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
Nothing, I chickened out.
Okay then... let's get ya started.
What is it now?
Are you still looking for a job?
I guess.
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off back to Essex!
Fucking mad!
Again?
Goodbye, Mary.
By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine.
Al Capone!
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Michael...
Then the legs at the knees...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
Michael, I love you.
...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
Yeah, can I help you?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
No students work for me.
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
Which one's your building?
Building two.
Why?
I don't know.
Dear Jesus...
Why are you mad?
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
I don't know.
I guess the news youd sent me after Friedman didnt go down too well, eh?
You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
Homework assignment.
What is it?
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
Start over.
It was a great show, Dad...
Perfect.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
What?
Oh - uh - nothing.
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
No, he was real.  Like on TV.
She knows.
See y'at the Finish Line.
Tell'em to fly the Inaugural Speech past me.
Fine.
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
Again?
Read it!
Over... my... dead... body!
Where to?
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Will you give me...
Don't sweet lip me.
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
I told you, he isn't here.
Out for the evening?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
When's he due back?
Convulsion?
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your daughter is not her bed, it's her brain.
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
I volunteered.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...
That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
So you saved her.
Yeah.  But not for long.
We don't have time!
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
Will it?
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
A perfect moment?
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
No...
My very best to Johnnie... Bless his soul.
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
Big bitches need love, too, Craig.
I...
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
What?
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
He's a big one. You two tight?
Yeah.
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
I'm just some guy.  A guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous.
In the battle, sir.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.
Im moving to Paris...it was right here...  Its a box marked Jack.  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Paris?
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
You can't.
Oh?
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
...In some weird way I respect that.
Yeah.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Well, I never heard that one.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
That's what you think.
What about newspapers and magazines?
Same thing?
So what do we do now?
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea?
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Uh-huh.
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
The Last Resort!  Quick!
Suck my cock!
Oh, Morgan!
I need to whizz.
Keep going.
Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
What'll we do out there?
Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something
What's that?
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
He had to.
I'm not.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
What would have elapsed?
If we wait till Mon...
When did you write the check?
Yest...
What was yesterday?
Tuesday.
And when was that check cashed?
I don't know.
What was the earliest it could have been cashed?
Little sons of bitches.
His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
I don't look like no possum!
Act like one!
What would you call it?
Now, that was a look.
This is crazy.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
Surprise me.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit.
<i>The tough get going.</i>
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
You ok?
ooohhhhhh no.
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
Thank you, Number One.
Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Shit.
Yes, I am.
What are you trying to tell me?
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
Why I don't...
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
Excuse me...
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
Right away!
Working....Under cover.
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
No, Mr. Dowd, you'll see me in court. I'm prosecuting this case.
Not so loud.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
Kay, I told you...
Goodbye, Michael.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
Michael.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
You haven't heard me.
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Yes, sir.
Uh, Matthew...
Back off, George.
But I-- .
I'll handle it.
I... um...
Come on.
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.
Don't bother
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
But I'm not prepared to die.
I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
In this heat?  They're up now.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Yes sir.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
No, sir.
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
No, sir.
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
I thought you meant...
You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
Only from a distance.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
I don't need the Baptists on my back, but I suppose I could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
What else is ballast for?
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
You'll have to pack quickly.
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
A parka.
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
North!
STOP!
No...
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
I don't know if I can with my leg.
Well, there's only one way to find out.  Give it a little gas.
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
Yeah.
It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
I just can't believe it.
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
What? No! Look.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
You miss me?...
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
No, why?
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
You assumed wrong.
Smile, little sister, smile.
Yeah.
That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
Gee, thanks boss.
Double-meaning intended, right?
Right ...
Another woman?
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
You know who it was?
The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up--here it is--
What is?
Anything.
Promise you won't forget me.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
It makes all the difference.					 *
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
Yes, I will.
No, you won't.
Somehow, I'll know!
You won't remember!
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
I thought so too! I was sure you'd				* remember. But you didn't.					    *
Like where--in your dreams?
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Shut up and turn to page 64.
We have to start looking for a shrink.
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
Then I can wear men's clothing.
That would hardly be proper.
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
David, let's go now.
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
We will, kiddo.
Hi.
What are you talking about?
I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
Are you going down?
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
I'll go. I'll go.
For emphasis?
Exactly.  It's the key.
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
What?
Where's the note?
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
A few indiscretions in his youth.
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Packs everything, including a gun.  Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
Thanks.
Nick, she won't say why.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Oh, Jesus.
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
Got it.
What music?
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
Why not?
I'm afraid.
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
Yes.
I'm not hungry.
We can't.
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
You don't think weapons are important?
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
You really in trouble?
Stop.
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Just don't ask me no more shit.
Picard to Crusher...
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Really?...
Arnold. What's happening?
But you don't really mean it.
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
It's been a while.
No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter.
Yes.
Thank you.
Like how?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Mild stroke?
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Up and around?  Soon?
Soon.
Yes, I understand that.
Wow.  Thank you.
No.  Thank you.
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
You can't get away with..
My <u>tail</u> itches.
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
Send that.
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Next month is June.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
June? That's my wife's name.
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
O.K.! Send that!
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Sure.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
The heart pumps it.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
The nerve centers -- the brain --
But what makes a thought start?
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look --
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Oh, I love that stuff.
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
There is no softer ground than town.
I've changed a lot lately.
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Is that a threat?
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Thank you.
It's that jerk Walter.
What happened?
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.
Do as I tell you!
He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
What is this?
I'm superstitious. Drink.
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
Why didn't you finish this game?
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be "Federal". With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased.
Yeah.
So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower.
Morning, darling.
Morning.
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
There's no witnesses...
No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Maddox!  You got that?
Who's recruiting?
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Yes, please.
I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work...
My house.  I want to try something.
Don't mention it--
I mean it. I--without you, I could't've--
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
Recommendations?
Who?
Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope. Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
A little bit of both.
Yeah, whatever.
I mean it!
Adios.
It surprises me.  It really does.
Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
Sucks for you.
Who's your partner?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
Their weapons missing?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Where's my gun?
I will finish what I've begun
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
It's alright, isn't it?
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
That is our most modestly priced receptacle.
Can you love a player?
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
Wrong?  Look at this!
Too bad.
I'm for that.
Did you hear me?!
Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks.
I am master now.
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Can we get another room?  Just put it on my credit card.
We're focusing.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
What chip?
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
I thought you were a man of God.
I am. But I'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas.
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
Congratulations, Enzo.
Don't you agree, Jacques?
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
People come first, Dr. Isley.
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
What happened, Doolittle?
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
I'm supposed to be on vacation.
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
Open it.
You'd like me to kill them?
I'm not the one to ask...
Do you know who this is?
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
Thank ...you.
Anytime.
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
The case was stolen?
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Mother!
I can make my own decisions.
He must leave me alone.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
No!
From your lips, to God's ears.
You go first.
Ladies first.  I insist.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Yeah?
And I was wondering.
Yeah?
If you don't have...I mean...
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
- and picked us up in the States -
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
I remember..
I don't know the number.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
Of course not.
You could help us.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow...
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
When did you get back?
Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?
Whaddup?
Why are you...don't stop...why?
"Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit!
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
Just as you are, Sir...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
No.
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
I'm on the staff of...
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Do you, indeed.  I'll bet you do. Fine.  Fine.  We'll save the court the time.  We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine.
No.  To the pain.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side.
It's beautiful.
A little dusty.
George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
He's been dead for three months.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
The Russian would be easier.
Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
But what?
What will I tell Annie?
Let me see!
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
You okay?
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Talk to me about costs, here.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
What?  Right Here?
Step into my office.
Yes?
Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere, and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
But you still think she's innocent.
I do.
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
Well, that's nice.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
Oh, no...
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
That's...
"...for my father."
I'm so sorry.
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Did you tell her?
What?  No.  No.
You didn't?
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
It was a mistake.
... Yes?
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
... Are you joking?
He didn't want me to.
Why not?
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He'd call every once in a while.
He called the day he escaped.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Did you know that when you married him?
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
Easy, easy --
I thought they came right past here 
They do, but -- there are no lights out there - they'll just be shadows -
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
Voices from an old dark house!
Oh...
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
I'll do anything to help.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
Deal.
What did you see, Chekov?
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
M'I gonna see you tonight?
That's right.
Then I'm doing fine.
What's new onna street?
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
She had beautiful hands.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
No, no! Just with her hands.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
I see you.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Okay, Sandy.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Who?
Twombley.
No shit.
You think Jack shot him?
Well, it was an accident.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
Pardon me
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
I wish you'd...
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
What for?
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
That's it?
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
I did alright.
I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Well what do you think it is?
Wait here.
Nothing about the porters yet?
Porters?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
Shhh!
Huh?
I can't believe you said that.
What did I say?
I told you he's crazy.
Where does he live.
Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around.
Yes, the child ...
They're fuckin' with us.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
Give it to me!!!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I want it!
Am I a suspect?
No. It would be convenient, but no.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
And the rule was...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
I have 6 tons.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Not as much as you'd think.
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
Bonanza Jellybean?
What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two...
I don't believe this.
Three.
Damn! What are the odds?
What?
That's the one I wanted.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that -
It's a smelting retort.
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
I'll try.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
When you get to Fiji?
You got it.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
Sorry!
Now don't kid a kidder.
This plane can not land!
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
Three days.
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
Oh, sure!
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Well, what about all your other friends?
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
I didn't.
What are you talking about?
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
Excuse me?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
It looks....foreign.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
No.
Does she know where she's going?
In my room.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
What's the matter with you?
Don't be so bloody nave.  You know there's a war breaking out.  This arrived this morning.  By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
Perfect! Perfect!
I wish you luck, sir.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Good.
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
We know all that we need to know --
But there's so much to tell you --
Don't.  That will come later.
Will it?
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
It's important.
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
Probably because we've never met.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
I haven't seen you around here before.
Home school. Til today.
Home school? What's that?
I go to school where I live.
Me too!
You have any children?
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
His . . . whatever.
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
Oh, that's nice.
Yes.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
You can believe that if you want to.
Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
Tijuana.
They were here?
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
He deals in pain.
Is Kristen safe?
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
Don't be smart.
I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
Work with me.
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
But Greta say --
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
The wound is bleeding!
Go to sleep!
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
She never particularly cared for me.
She didn't love you?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
She held that against you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
Simulated one.
What?!
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
People liked him.
Most people did, yeah.
I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
The phone call.  The knapsack.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
Shelly?
Miss her?
Yes.
Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
This is what we do?
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Are you on drugs?
Kelly--
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Part of our research--
I'm not even a field person.
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
Why not?
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs.
Yes, Max?
Am I collateral?
No.
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
More.
See that scrub oak yonder?
Fuck you.
He's blind, for Chri...
I ain't blind, you asshole.
HERE THEY COME!
OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
Music.
Its an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  Im gonna buy it...
Drink lots of water.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Right. The blond guy.
OK. That's wrong.
Dignan, it's --
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
What?
Wish you weren't.
Do you know how much I love you?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
Why would he pick this one?
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Not that I know.
Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
The jockey!
COME ON, RUSSELL!
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
You sure that's the reason?
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
Gibarian.  He was here.
You said he was dead.
He is.  But he was here...
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Engine room! What's happening?!
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
In radio we're different.
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
Well, I was wondering if we could...
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
What is your position?
Second musketeer.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
You seem to understand a great deal.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
Equals?
If you wish to play games, Major.
Me?
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
I don't want to.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
Blow me.
What did you say?
Show me.
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
Sorry, dude.
Bye bye, Jane. And dont be naughty.
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
Fine.  Be that way.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
No.
Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
What do you want from me?
Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town.  And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons.
I don't know what to say.
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
You won't say anything to my parents?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
We sometimes went downtown to score.
What?
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away.  And neither does she.
Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -
Someone pop your balloon?
No problem, no problem.
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
Oh, sure.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Oh, wow.
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
I am going after them.
Look at the tiny figures.
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
Forget I asked.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
No, it's not like that.
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
I see you go to the night court.
I've made the scene.
Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
Don't you see...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
... that this is all my fault?
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
This is your ship?
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
El Capitan?
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
What do you want?
A beer?
A beer.  Of course.
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
What?
Listen, it's not erasing.
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Give me a drag.
This is not cool.
It was cool last night.
I have to go.
Are you telling me no?
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
....this is your mistake....
You can't come in here.
What dya mean?
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
You think this is all a joke?
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
I believe in him.
No.  That's stupid.
Are you sure?
Well, not exactly.
For a while.
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you can't miss it.
I thought you quit.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
All right.
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
I thought the gloves were off.
-- as long as he's got secret files on everybody.  I don't want 'em used against us.  What about the CIA?  Helms's done nothing for us.  I want to see him.
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Give me a date, Doctor.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
Get on with it then.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
And you were gonna pay me back?
I am after this race.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
Yes.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Did you see Jack?
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
I really don't know.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
Okay.  Then we go this way.
Its the only way out...
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was fine the way it was--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
--mine's better--
--no way--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman...
Call me Charlie.
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
So have dinner with me tonight.
I can't.
It's your choice.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
Microwave.  Five minutes.
What?
You didn't hear?
Hear what?
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Did the police contact you?
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
What does she do for you?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Beaumont worked for you.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Was she?
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
But he was such a good cop.
They always are.
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
Spanish kinda guys!
Business thing.  Gimme a seven and seven, willya?
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
Some tap dancing, some singing.
Where do I sign?
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Yeah. Maybe.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Can we split now?
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
No more dentists, no more dentists...
It'll get better now.
It wasn't him.
Who was it?
Me.
Who?
Al.
Thanks for the consultation....
Honey, what happened?
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
What about me?
You're different.
I am?
You're great.
I am?
Yeah.
Do you really mean that?
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Who's "Eleanor?"
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
Then why are you so upset?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
Better late than never, right?
Wrong.
"Hmm" what?
"But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
I don't know yet.
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
Uh-uh-why?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
No, I'm fine.
Dead on all channels.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
What were you fighting for?
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
What happened here?
Nothing. I broke a lamp.
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
You have other information?
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
To the Black Pearl.
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Your mess.
Then shut up.
My place.
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
You did.  You murdered by Boss.  Now...  They're looking to me.  Personally I'd pass on the jab.  I don't enjoy being this close to you.
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
And nobody did anything?
Me!
You're in league with Barbossa!
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
Ha. Ha.
Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
Tell me about it.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
Not just every six weeks.
Yeah, I know.
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
Get over there!
Look, I talked to him and it's not going to be a helicopter - they can't land on top of the roof - so they're comin' with a big ... limousine bus and they'll take us to the airport - and they're gonna get a jet ... so things are rollin' ... they're movin' ... I also ordered some food ... I got some pizzas for us, all right?  I got some things to drink - I got sodas ... I even asked them for aspirins ... I'm doin' what I can ... now I gotta pay for the pizza ... where are the marked bills?
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Can we phone them in, Paul?
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
Big surprise.
South Central.
How long, you figure?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
I know.  I know-- you would not tell me.  Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me.  Oh well -- I shall find him.  Time is on my side.
I have so got brains.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
No big deal.
So you've indicated. Do it.
I want you to help my little girl.
I'm only a student.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
Did he tell you about Georgina?
Okay.    Not.
I'd better get in there.
That's a lot of people all at once.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
What are they?
There was a recipe on the back  --
Something you can feed the pets, perhaps?  Let's have it.
I don't know.
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
Yes you did.
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
Beverly Hills --
What?
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
C'mon --
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
I'm sorry.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I'm a little worried, James.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing.
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
Get in the car!
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
It's mine to risk.
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
I won't tell mom if you don't.
When did you start smoking?
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
You have?
A few times.  Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
My gun?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
I need it.
You trust me, don't you?  Just give it to me for a second.
No kidding?
...I'm going to need your help...
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
I'm going to help her.
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it.  We let them buy the case.  That's what I took it for.  You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
Damned if I know.
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
Clever.  George.
Know what, honey?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
Uh...home...
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
I don't see anything.
Are you absolutely certain?
I can't do this now... please.
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Lisa! Shut up!
Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
--there's nothing new in it--
--it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story--  --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--
This is our bedroom.
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
You haven't finished your beer.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
I got my whole life to drink.
That's fine.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Who came in after you?
Lieutenant  Quinn.
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Know what?
That there was a gun pointed at me.
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
Because that's what I would have done...
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Fine.  I'll say no.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Fine.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
No, I have to work.
How un-sixties of you.
I was nine in the sixties.
I used to think my biography would be JACK LUCAS - THE FACE BEHIND THE VOICE, but now it can be JACK LUCAS, THE FACE "AND" THE VOICE...or maybe just JACK - EXCLAMATION POINT...
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
No, don't!
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
I will.
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
We keep our mouths shut.
We be honored, friend Ogg.
There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist.
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
What? By myself?
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
Firenze.
You're welcome, John.
But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.
I think it's closed.
I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
Jennifer.
Yeah, sweetheart?
Let's do it.
Do what?
Move to Mars.
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
I always liked ya so much...
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
I don't think so.
This is your house, right?
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
No, you're his wife.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
It don't look right.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
And you're drinking with them right now.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
Yeah.
You sent me to him.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
Who's she?
She's on TV.
If you don't start telling the truth... 
What do we do?
We keep going.
We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
Nothing.
Don't feel like nothing.
We don't have much choice then, do we?
No one knows...
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
What scars?
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
If he files are you going to take the case?
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
What's she like?
Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!
Me?
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
Slow down, kid.
I don't want to see her hurt.
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
Just out for a while.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Oh, come on Dad...
No.  Upstairs.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
So we'll put a warning on the label.
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
He's pretty young for that job.
Well, no younger than I was.
Maybe you were born older, George.
How's that?
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things . . . design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
Into the Hudson?
Uh-huh.
Has her books in it.
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
On what?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Like what?
Oh...I'll think of something.
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Where?  Maybe we can.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME. . ....Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
But --
It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
They grow outside, don't they?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
You going to take me on a nature walk?
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
I fell asleep.
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
Well, yeah, but --
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
I just don't want to see you get your hopes up. You know how you get.
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
Billy!  Billy!
What's it look like?
Walter, I'm sorry...
You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Show it to me.
You mean Delaware?
No. New York.
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
No ...
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Well, if that's possible ...
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes.
You read about it, I'm sure.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
I thought you would have some ideas.
Why should I tell you?
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
Pray tell.
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantage?
You're insane.
You're very tan, Will.
Objection!
I peeked.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
I don't expect to.
Are you sure he's still alive?
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Do you really want me to?
Yes I do.
I got up.
You can't know that for sure.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
Who?
Mrs Brown.
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
What's her excuse this time?
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
I was trying to imagine "rather upset."
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
Do you really think so?
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
What did you do that for?
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right.
Virginia...?
What?
Do you have any weapons?
The best. But we won't need them.
Just the same, I want one.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Sorry about that... I just...
Oh, it's alright.
Right.
But... how is he going to breathe?
He isn't going to breathe.
Not yet!
The planetarium!
Vince!
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Yep.
I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
Hitler!
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
I was all of these.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
What about Oleg?
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
No, he is here.  Shit...
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What's your cut?  How much?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
No.  No way.
But it's...
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
What else do you need?
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Give me another one, please.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
It's too late for that.
What do I do?
What do you do?
I'm a revolutionary.
What are you doing here?
It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores.
Beautiful.
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
Miles.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
She what?  When?
About a month ago. Six weeks.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
Nathan told my brother.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
I'll take a bus.
I'll take you... why not?
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
Thank you.
Shut up!  Who is this?
It is still regulation, Admiral.
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
Dr. Lecter...
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Out.
Want me to come?
No thanks.
Come on, honey.
Feeling the pressure?
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
I know.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
I know.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
What about him?
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
Yeah?
Are the TV people with you?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Send him away.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No.
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
No. It's a mess.
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
Where'd you hear that?
Around.
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
Fuck you.
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
I'm so hungry.
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
I don't really like your friends either.
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
You were attracted to me?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Wait, I was going to tell you--
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
But now you don't have to--
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
Call a cruiser!
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
I don't know.
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
I know you've been trying to kill me.
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
So now you know.
So it's time to go home.
That's all I get?
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
I don't think so.
We have to go home, Jason.
Jason Bourne is dead.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Keep it. 
Jason...  They can't let you go...
That'll be their second worst mistake.
Nope.
See?
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
What?
Our cards, please.
What cards?
You have our cards.
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
How much?
One thousand francs.
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
Like what?
Like...
Tell me. What do the police say?
They're calling it an accident.
Who's the investigating officer?
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
Do you know him?
Oh yes.
Where from?
We worked in Chinatown together.
Would you call him a capable man?
Very.
Honest?
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
None.
That's too bad.
Too bad?
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
Let me have a look.
What are you suggesting?
When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
Just radio for help, okay???
Now you tore the other one.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
Maybe you're happy.
Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch.  Trust.
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
I got a call from the F.B.I.  The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.
You must have some money.
Just a few bucks.
And Myra's stuff?
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
At what?
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
What?
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
I know you do, so that's why --
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
No.
Why are you mad at each other?
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Uh huh.
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Did Daddy tease you?
Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Just sandwiches...
Right.
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
Yeah you did...
Right... You have a boat.
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
The "come back" kind.
How do you know that?
Takes one to know one.
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
You don't know.  You don't....
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
I have to reset the sub.
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
I can't do that!
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Red Rum.
Are you having a bad dream?
I would hardly say you look like trash.
No thanks to you.
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.
How do you know so much?
None of your business.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
I was a traffic analyst.
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
It wasn't a trick!
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
You're just jealous.
Jealous? Of what?
Of this...Superman.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
You got a point there...
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
Can I help you?
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
Oh, no.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Really?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
Will I go crazy or something?
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
Why not then?
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
Come over around seven.
O'clock?
Yeah...
Gotcha.
I rode here, on my horse.
Chose another.  Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Bye.
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
I'll take him.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
You'd hate him for the trick.
Not if what he left me was real.
Imagine how he feels.
Not now, Jonah --
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
Jonah, I'm leaving --
WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Having a nervous breakdown.
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That's very simple. I was home.
I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
Leave.  Now.
Can I say something in my defense?
No.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
Uh huh.
I just can't . . see it anymore
Prisoner exchange.
Sir?
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
What officers?
Yeah, I met her already.
Shut up!

Here here...
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
Oh, but I have.
I'll have you out in a few hours.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
My next word was gonna be "consciousness."  Swear to God... tubby.
Alexander Pope?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
It's no big deal.
You are such a sweetheart.
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
How do you know?
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
Ma'am.
You are here safely.
Aye, ma'am.
You are well?
I am.
And the pony?
She's well, too.
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
For the same reason you did, to help.
Yeah, let's go.
Are you still coming?
Yes.
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
How's your <u>child</u>?
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Why don't you answer?
I know I won't be your puppet.
You can go now.
I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
Aren't you going out today?
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
I have the stuff from last year's...
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
It means, "Never without my permission".
That's what I thought.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
I love you too, man.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.
What's that, Frank?
Three legs.
That's too many.
Backup?
It's coming.
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
No. I won't be long.
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
What do you want me to say?
You said this ship creates a gateway...
Yes...
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
I don't know...
Where has it been for the past seven years?
I don't know...
The "Other Place," what is that...?
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.
Laurie!  Good to see you.
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
But if he knew we have so little time -
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
What would it take?
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
I don't know yet.
They gone to the field...
Guess I can't just lay here, then.
Are there any special instructions?
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
If you say so.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
Yes.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
I have this effect on lots of women.
I bet you do.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
Alan's in Utah.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
You are a rich woman.
See what I mean?
Is that right?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
How could you let her see this?
Goodbye, Bobby.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
I already have.  Come on.
Oh.
Call me Nancy.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
What! Get married?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
That's why I asked you...
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
Okay, that's where you want to be.
Fuck it! Hold tight!
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
I had a teacher like that once.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
As for instance?
Well....
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Are you hungry?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
Phillip, you're mad!
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
At-at-at-at-at.
If you know, I know.
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
We're all here.
Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Youre all in this together?
What's wrong with oxygen?
It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.
Are you?
You're goddamn right I am.
What about Bill?
He's in love with you.
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Why should he - and why should you?
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
Isn't that what they always say?
You too.
He wanted more than that.
Don't lie to me.
All right, so I made another deal.
I got a new deal for you.
I've got plenty of places to go.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
Here?
Yes, sir, he --
Tell him to go away --
Are you angry with me?
No!
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
I didn't say that.
Are you in love with someone else?
My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.
Yellow pages?
Let your fingers do the walking.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Wow!
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Watch my stuff.
Please.
You're done.  End of story.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
Why don't you get out of my face.
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
Of course you are. You don't know what I was like before I met you. You're like the best counselor ever.
I'm not giving up.
You must.
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Nonsense.
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
You don't have to...
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
You know it.
Mistake?
Yes. Not my department ... I'm only records. It seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval. I don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose we're all human.
Go for it.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
I won't have to.
Washed away.
One more out.
What is it, a surprise?
That's right...
Everything okay?
Huh?
Nothing.
To recruit you.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
That's me, Sir.
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
one minute -- !
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
It's not the same thing, is it?
They sound like you.
The Nazis did everything the fhrer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
Fuck her.
He's in his room, playing.
Good.  I'll see him in there.
I'm going out!
You're not going anywhere!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
Frances!
Hello, Mr. deMille.
Head-shrinker?
Move you fools!
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Well, I am.
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
Your face smells like a foot.
You smell like ass!
Sioux Indian, right?
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I don't.
This one has a special meaning.
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
You'll never get away from me!
What are you doing here?
No! Not the camera guy!
I'm telling you!
I... puppeteer.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
How did she die?  I wanna know.
You don't wanna know.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
I wish he was.  He's real enough.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
Trilithium?
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
I think you had better leave
Get on this, right now...
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
...this's <u>good</u>...
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
<u>Yes</u>:  she is saying this in Albanian, <u>but</u> she's doing it not to be uh...  But because, she explains, that is the only way it can be understood by her Aged and Sainted Mother, who is standing there with her, dressed in her Traditional...
What do you want to break?
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Why?
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
Let me think.
Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
He was doing a great job.
Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
Oh, leave me alone.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
You borrowed money from your mother?
Yes!
Well, don't do that again!
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Don't be stupid.
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
We have matching luggage.
What?
Can you recommend a restaurant?
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
Where do you eat?
At Pre Mathieu's.
Where is that?
It's just a place for workmen.
Where is it?
Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.
Yes, my lord.
There'll be other chances.
Not like this.  Are you even listening?
We're supposed to.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
Suspicious, after all these years?
You change partners, you change the rules.
It'll just be a few days.
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
That's a different dress.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is. I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read Italian.  He can catch rabbits.
I'd just be guessing.
Guess!
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
I do not love him.
You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here.
Hm.  Is it?
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
Give it up.
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
What is it?
Just some fatherly advice.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
You're probably mistaken about that.  Let's get together sand talk it over.  There's always a solution to these problems.  But it must be near the water.  Quite near--  Yes, if you don't mind waiting.
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
What happened to Adele?
Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman.
Well, what happened?
The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
Wait, don't hang up.
Okay?
What are you doing?
Reading.
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Rod, get on the camel.
Position?
Can't lock up...
Talk to me, Hudson.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
What kind of man are you?
You have no idea. Now run away.
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
Yeah.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Yeah.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
No, not that.  I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
You enjoy it?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Tell me what happened.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Nobody saw you bring her in?
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
What did you do with her body?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Show me.
Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
What?
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Like songs?
Yeah, they could be songs.
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Now?
Yeah.
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
She left a note.
Fuck you.
How about I just press the button?
He means they're thieving dogs.
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
Um -- not right now.
Put some ice on it.
Harry?  Can you copy?
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
Morning.
You people looking for work?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Can you pick peaches?
We can pick anything.
Well, there's plenty of work for you about forty miles north, this road just outside Pixley. Turn east on 32 and look for Hooper's ranch. Tell 'em Spencer sent you.
We'll be all right...  We will...
Uh-huh.
It wes a dream...!
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Stop it!
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
ENOUGH!!!
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
Since when?
Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
When the game's over, I guess.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
Yeah. A real tragedy.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
And you admired him?
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
You knew him best.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
Yes, I know...
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
Both of us...
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Were you with him, when...
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
Ray Reddy's house.
Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
What do maniacs always want?
Recognition, of course.
Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card.
Right on the money!
Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?
Hmm?  See them?
May we look at them now?
Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
It's a 27B/6 of course.
Just for now.
Hold me.
Was this trip really necessary?
T-turned on?
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
I can't.  I gotta go home.
Like what?
Maybe this Jeffrey guy is...is my real father. I mean...look at me, I have the hair of a dead person and...and my nose, no one in my family has this nose, it could be the nose of...a...of a complete stranger,
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
So I hear. Is that all?
No, that's not all.
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
Maybe I won't.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
You did.  Well... thank you.
See you.
This chink have a name?
Bubba.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Fire moat... why do that?
Purely a precaution...
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
Dude, prom sucks.
I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night.  Chicks are gonna want to do it.
...check...?
The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
...you're definitely doing a story...?
Yes, sir.
I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  I know I shouldn't tell you this...
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
Good.
Don't cry, Amy.
She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!
I'm sorry...
What are you doing here?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Are you nuts or something?
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
Harry, let me answer that.
I know.
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
What?
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
Yes, but...
We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
Really?
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
...in the course of that night, Mr. O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man...
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Well, let's check it out.
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
It makes you nervous?
Yes.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
Would you really have drawn my blood?
If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
No thanks.
I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
I'm not on my own, am I?
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
Yes, sir.
Thanks, I needed that.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Have fun.
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
Frances, I'm warning you...
No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
In due time.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
Huh?
He's trying to form words.
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
What?
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
That's not it.
Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
You don't understand! It's her father...
Mr. Rose *knows*?
He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
What happened to Cole?
He retired.
Where?
Upstate.
Upstate where?
Atascadero.
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
Come to the rescue again I see.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
What?  Who?
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
Who do you think!
Things seem to be getting better.
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
Experiments?
It can't rain all the time.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
I don't care.  <u>Fix</u> it.
Did they hurtcha?
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Put down Lex Luthor?
Good morning.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Let's make it an even million.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
We should talk alone.
I can't. I need my family around me now.
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
I'm just as human as you.  I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
Neither do I.
No, you have a press agent do it.
Don't you read Shakespeare?
We can take these guys!
I see.
I see.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
I'm never conversational before I coffee.
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
How?
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
How do you know he's telling the truth?
What kind of park is it?
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
But you have no proof.
No, Miss Ratched...
And yet you suspect her.
Yes, that is correct.
Why?
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
Merry Christmas, son.
No, not really.
Interesting.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
That didn't sound like thunder.
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
I should be trying to stop you.
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
I found it outside.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
He's up with your father.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Aw, God.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
Interesting.
Nothing comes.
Most interesting.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
I don't know.
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
There are straps in back.
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?
Hey, look--
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Drive.
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Whatcha got there?
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Well, let me have it.
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
I'll do my best.
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
It's his way.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
It's your favourite...
Who are you?
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
Marie's dead Mama.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
Who are you?
I... I'm Martha, Mama.
You know I do.
You need a few dollars.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I understand...
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
Aloha, Spicoli.
Jesus!
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
Every guy has a type!
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
What do you mean?
I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
Then why are you here, Joe?
I came to see you.
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
Very well, I'll watch.
Watch me do what?
Whatever you do.
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
And I'll be a visitor.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
I don't mind --
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
I'm totally serious!
Father, that's enough now
And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
Such as?
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
Do I know who lives down there?
You can find out.
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
Pretty big chance, huh?
You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
Have you ever tried to develop it?
I don't know what you're asking?
You're skill.
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
Been busy, have you.
How d'you mean?
It's been a while.
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
That's not what I heard.
What was that, then?
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
It was the bars, then.
No.
Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
You don't have to say anything
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Please, there's no... Oh.
I wasn't saying anything.
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
It's his dog.
It's an important speech.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
This ain't even workin' wrong!
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Great. I'll see you soon.
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
--It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty...
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
It always is with Clark.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
You try anything, it goes in...
...the river.
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...
...-tainer!
Where's Arlo?
Bring him up.
...it's on.
Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
You'd be surprised.
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
And where are they now?
No you can't Kenny!
Mph rm rmph!!
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
Mph mm!
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress.
Surprised!
Love me?
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
That's nice.
And you like them?
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
Just someone so young...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I... I don't think so.
Does that mean you don't like me?
No, of course not.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In what way do you mean?
In whatever way you think I mean.
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
...What do you mean?
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
I came to see Merle.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
Yeah.
You are his friend.
Where is he???
Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.
His private life?
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Why is that impossible?
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
How honorable of you.
They weren't there. Get close-ups.
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
Why?
What's that?
Thanks.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Red or white?
Both.
Owh...
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
How come you're not eating?
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Lee...
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Yes.
So now they believe me.
Yes, they believe you.
A tractor beam...
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
My shoes.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
What happened?
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Jesus!
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
I guess.
Like I said; you really can't blame the boy.  Some people don't know how to avoid trouble.  Know what I mean?
Here's the Surgeon.
That's right, Modern Times.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
Yes. 
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
What's that to miss?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
Does Chicago count?
You lived in Chicago?
When I was first married.
You were married to a woman in Chicago?
What?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Why?
I don't know.
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
That's what I'm saying.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
Go to hell!
Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
I think maybe over a hundred.
That's right you travel so much.
Yeah.
... what?...
That headboard.
Nobody can hear it.
What?
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
I know.  But chances are...
Chances are there's still a chance.
You too...Meat.
Sooner than the Fall.
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
What?
Guess!
They repealed Prohibition?
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
Watch me.
Huh?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
So do I.
You do?
Yeah.
You like it?
Bravo!
Thank-Q!
What?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
No.
It's there.
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
Has he?
No.  But he would, probably.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
Yes.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Yes!
Are these the articles?
Yes!
Were you present when all these things took place?
Yes!
Are they true!
NO!!
But they did take place?
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
And you saw them happen?
Yes, but I
That's all, Miss Bennett.
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
You don't know the real me.
Andy... there is no real you.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY

Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days...
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
Jack!
Long time no see!
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
You sound worried.
Me? - if I'm worried about anyone, it's you. What happened to you, Sam? You were the brightest of us -
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
Look out.
What'd you come back for?!
Why'd you stay behind?!




Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
I am all attention.
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
A little...
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
I didn't make him for you
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
know, but
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
Look out!
You hate women.
False.
True.
Not true.
You have a King fantasy.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
And what happens when you can't?
New king.
...would you excuse me...?
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Running away is no solution.
All right, hit those lights too.
The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
Sleep well.
Two.
Extra money, huh?
Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
I'm calling in sick.
I pray God grants it me.
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
--but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.
Stand...?
Retire.
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
I heard.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
I plan to. Soon.
How soon?
This spring.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Yes.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Oh.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
Why can't we pick up his signal?
Shut up!
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
No.
What do you want, then?
Nothing.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
No, I didnt...thats great.
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
Uh huh...
I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
Heh heh, thanks.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Phone for help?  We're right in the middle of nowhere. There isn't a town within ten miles of here.
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
What is it?
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Where?
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
Did they try and fail?
They tried and died....  Jessica!
Very much.
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
I'd rather read, thank-you.
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
Oh God!  He killed them!
Don't worry, we'll get it...
I'm worried.
Me too.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Easy enough.
Good...Well...Take care.
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
No. I just gotta go find him.
Is that a question?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Yes.
There there...
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
You don't understand this guy.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
I'm not running.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
At this point we don't have much.
How much they want?
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
Ugh ...
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
This is hardly the time or the place.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
I don't want to talk about it.
You will not screw this up.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
<u>WHAT</u>?
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can, in your life, save this one person.
But I would.
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
What if I say no?
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
You want to know my idea of a marriage? It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there's a down...and when there's an up, well, hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.  I needed that, John.  I deserved that.
All right. Be careful.
You fucked with me for the last time!
Okay, yeah.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
Alright, I love you.
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
"Fuck the Machine"? "Fuck the Machine"?  What is this.  Courtesy class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  You want to...
I'm going parading before it's too late!
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
The truth is...
Remind me why.
Because it pays off.
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
So?
He does it all by himself.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
Half don't...Bring her about....
I am...You must know something about him....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
Nothing. Why?
Why, you look beautiful.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
So, then whadda ya want?
Keep trying!
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
Who's that?
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
Nothing.
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
What do you think?
Can't you get him?
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
He never told me.
Well, let's go down and ask him.
Who?
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
I don't know.
How many pills were in that bottle?
It was half-full -- about a dozen or so. You going to have to take her to the hospital?
Sure.
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
You're such a retard!
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
What is?
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
I'll get some.
You've said that for weeks.
I know.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
Chris!
All right.  All right.
I couldn't go near that woman.
I said all right!
It's a fire fight.
Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Peter-- my condolences.
Are you trying to panic the women?
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
Sure.  Just a minute.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
Not yet.
You think they're still up there?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
That might not be so bad... at least for you.
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
Thanks.
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
I hope not.
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
And what about you?
You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
You don't call.
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
Right.
So I don't call either way.
Right.
So what's the difference?
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
Right.
Well that sucks.
It sucks.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
Unless she comes back first.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
There's the rub.
There's the rub.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
Hey man, don't sweat it.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
No problem.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
I'll keep that in mind.
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
Company's not here, is it?
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
Yeah.
Maybe.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Since when have things been normal?
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
Nope.
Good news?
Hey! -
- to her cooking.
The one time I want it to work...
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
I've literally got to run!
I won't try to keep up with you. I'm not as fast on my feet as I once was.
Come on in.
The phone made me do it!
You've been having strange sex...!
No, Brett, I...
It's all right...  So have I.
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
-- Yes?
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
Finally came to your senses, huh?
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
How are you?
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Did you solve your problems?
Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
You didn't get ketchup?
Gimme that damn thing.
It really wasn't that difficult.
I'm not leaving without you.
No. What is it? Tell me.
I met a man with sharp nails.
Scobie?
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
Take me to her.
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Lemme have the bag.
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Maybe this can wait.
Huh?
They're movin'.

A nickel.
Eight.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
Then we're screwed.
No we're not.
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
Let me see the files.
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
We have never been friends.
The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now.
What is <u>this</u>?
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
Do you recognize this young man?
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
...-lem?
You find yourself wearing a...
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
...you answer mine.
Got that?
So you don't remember...
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...seriously.
That's not the way I...
You got that right.
Then why you doin' it?
Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.
We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
Ok.
I don't freak out very often.
What do you mean?
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
...I don't know what you mean....
I don't freak out.
Ok.
Have a good trip.
Thank you.
All the time.
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
- Instant melt-down.
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
I'm fine, thank you.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
Well.  At wakes.
This is a little different.
I can look at dead things.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
Okay, friend.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
Gee.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
Why?
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
Honest?
Will you let me ask you some questions?
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
There a problem, Foley?
Yeah.
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Well done you.
Look at those eyes.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
What happened?
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
Who?
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
You own this land.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
What about the law?
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
Beholden to none.
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Just what are you saying?
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
Sure.
Uh, look, Diz...
Guess you gotta go.
You're the best.
Okay, Lou-is.
Basically...
Sire!
You wouldn't?
I am relaxing.
This is not relaxing.
Really?
Really.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
If you want me to.
I'm always open to learning new things.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Ah?!
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
NO!
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
We're still going to be together.
That won't be possible.
Really?
Of course, that's what friends are for.
Sure.
A job?
Yes, the money is good.
As a plumber?!
It's easy to learn.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
We started over, you can too.
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
You leave it.
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
Whatever gets you off.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
Sure.  Vivovich.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
For what?
For an introduction.
Well... nobody.
Just as you say, Doctor.
Thank you, Major. 
Good day, Doctor.
Good day, Major.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
Thank you.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
Yes, I know.
Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
Wait!
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
Lives and learns doesn't one.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
Hold it.
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
I need help, Audrey.
Again.
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Murdered him?
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
And mine goes with you.
You? No.
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
All right ... send them the guard.
All right ... let's go.
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
How long do you suppose we were waiting?
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
Really?  It makes me sick.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
You didn't care about my case?
I would now.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
Sure. Go ahead.
Should I kill them?
Why bother?
I put her to sleep.
H... how?
I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
I beg your pardon?
There wolf!  There castle!
Why are you talking like that?
I thought you wanted to.
No.
He was our teacher... He was great.
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
An Austrian.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, Id hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Fiction or non-fiction?
Why don't you shut up!
Well!
Are you going to listen?
Go on.
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
What do you mean?
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
You mean, you're a thief?
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
I don't believe it.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Oooh! That has the earmarks!
You know what we're saying!
LET THY SPIRIT
I think they hear you!
You know me to well.
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Yes...?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Would you recognize him again?
Yes.  I think so.
Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
What?
There's a cop behind us.
What?
Thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. So I left the bottle out as bait.
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
I thought you were buying my company.
Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
Nothing has changed as far as <my> authority goes! He is <not> going to operate! Not in the little time we have left! There's no chance of success! It's sheer suicide for all of us!
I'm a businessman, kid.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Fifty per cent?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Aaaahhhh!
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya.
Hey-
Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
Not much.
I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
Keys.
What?
What about my keys?
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Yes.
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
You're a real booger, you know it?
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
Not really.  This is pretty important.
She wants a picture.
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
You don't look angry.
How do I look?
Beautiful.
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
I know.
Where are you going?
Corleone.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
Don Tommassino...I should see this place.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Of course. I forgot.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Why not?
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
No...not air --
Really?
What would you like?
Something pretty.
Like you.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
How did you?...
...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me.  I hit the water hard.  And it was so...cold.
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.
But, Chip...
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You must have a visa or something...
You're asking for my documents?
No, no...
They're...
But I just don't feel it.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Speed?
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Call them every five miles.
Thirty-five, still straight.
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
You're exaggerating!
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
He goes out with girls.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
It'll warm you up.
Oh, cut the crap!
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasnt one of them.
I'm retired.
What did you do?
I'm a welder.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
Cast iron?
Yes.
I don't mean braze.
I didn't say braze.
Pot metal?
What did I say?
Were you in Nam?
Yeah. I was in Nam.
So was I.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
You're right, of course.
I don't think so.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
Get up there Rachel!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Go!
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
I need you.
Why?
I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
I'm sure.
No one would miss me.
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
Wait for what?
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
How can I trust --
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
My son is out there!
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
Thanks.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
Now who are we talking about?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
I don't know.
Mother . . .
Mother? What do you want?
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
I had to tell 'em something.
Never say anything unless you have to.
I thought so, too.
Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
Are you okay?
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
I don't know.
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
War.
Oh, hello Mother!
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
No, of course not.
You mean, I have your permission?
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
What are you doing here?
They don't bother me.
Yeah, you weren't in that last one.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
Come again?
You found the leopard!
We'll see you next week, and if--
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Say thank you.
Thank you.
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
Oh, yeah.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
That's scary sounding.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
I think so.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
Okay.
Yeah? Oh, great!
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
I'm not expecting anyone.
That's not what he thinks.
What did he look like?
You're beautiful.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
The police?
Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
You're only six-five once.
Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's get this day started.
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Well...
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
Not enough, I guess.
That's right.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
Mary . . .
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Who else you been to see?
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
You know why?  She was so -
Sure, sure.
I'm going back there.
Who else did you see?
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
He made an awful lot of money.
It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
What mess?
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
What?
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
Tell me what?
I just told you.
I mean, it's not true, is it?
What?
He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
You wrote his scripts for him?
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his  what about before that?
Before what?
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
But of course yours worked.
In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.
Yes.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Yes.
Oh, you were there?
No, but I heard it was great.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
Rowan...
HARDER!
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
Yessssss...
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Not an easy day to forget.
No.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
We need you here. I can bring her in.
No. I'll handle this.
Wasn't that hard.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
Too early to tell.
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Lauren's not my wife.
Girlfriend?
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Something.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Is the social studies class over for today?
Yeah...
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
Oh, yes.
She used to be so friendly.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
Not that.  Anything else.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
A list.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Well there....  What's the difference?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
<u>No!</u>  <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a contest</u>!
MMMMMM!!!!
In Costa Rica?
On the island.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
I know.
Well, goodbye.
That's all right, that's all right...
On accounta...
I'm gonna see you tonight...
You little liar! Get out of here!
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Hey, cool it Walter.
'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
Yes.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Yes.
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
Then I will go with you.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
I know how to fight!
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
I killed too many barbarians.
I'm a Greek, thank you.  And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians.  Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white.  Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend.
I can't.
Car pool?
Faint.
She didn't.
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Then come with us.
That's right.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
You mean for TV or print?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
-- red nose and ears. I know, I know.
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
As far as the office.
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
Course I did.
Lemme see it, will you?
You're in a playful mood.
For a question!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
For one week!
Is he fully aware that this bill has been months in both Houses--delayed and delayed--millions will be without food and shelter until its passage-- public works to relieve unemployment will be at a standstill--government agencies will be forced to suspend-- ?
It's Bud.
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.
Yeah, let's bury her.
Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
This is just an informal discussion.
Are you recording it?
What does it look like?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
No. Why should it?
Well, then?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Take another look at these two.
I don't know them.
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
Yes, I suppose so.
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
My, my... Ah, who are you?
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
I was listening, Kitten.
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
A rope!
No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
That rhymes.
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
What else?
What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con.
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
I'll make coffee.
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Roger. One-three-eight.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Listen, BratI'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
What do you mean??
Well the other night at dinner...
Oh that, she just likes to play.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
Harry, I really think she.....
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.
Never.
Here's the trouble with never.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
Look at 'em all.  They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
Well I hate it.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
If...?
I'm sorry.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
Some of it good, I hope.
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
There'll be red flags.
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.
What?
I believe that's the law... is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
I don't care! We'd be together.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
I can't do this. I can't leave you...
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
I want to fly jets, sir!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
No, sir!
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
Pity you don't have the character.
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
Not a fucking chance, asshole!
I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Almost right.
I can't wait to meet her.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
Viktor, it's my studio.
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
Yeah.  I know.
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
And where do you keep Mickey?
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
Who?
Wayne Gayle.
Wayne Gayle!
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Oh, you'll remember it some time.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
Well, you know what I mean.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
I'm exaggerating.
How much?
Jackie --
What?
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
He does?
Well yes -- you know that about George.
It's been so long I don't how long?
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
I would say so, yes.
Honey?
What?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
What's her address?  Where does she live?
Thank you.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
Then take the pills.
I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
Look, I'll call you, okay?
I was?
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
The same thing you do.
I adore him.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
We've only been over this how many times?
You only made half your quote this year.
Well, you're a tower of support.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.
Could it have damaged the ship?
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
Oh, and what did you do?
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
We?
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
Whew.
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
Thanks, Mom.
What?
Isn't that Lulu?
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
How much?
$20.
Let's go to the movies...on you.
From who?
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
She couldn't.
Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
The sensitive type.
Please.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
You sure?
It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.
Yes.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Yes, sir.
When you exit, head east on 10th.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
I don't know...
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Plus what I owe you?
I'll throw that in too.
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
I don't understand.
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
'Bout thirty seconds.
She lives near Eddie?
I think she lives down by Pitt.
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
I think by Twenty-two.
For real?
What you want with her anyway'
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
Thanks for reminding me.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Please let me help you.
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
It's me. Nicky.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
Prescription. For my condition.
What condition?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil!
Voil what?
Up there! I would put it up there!
Give it to me!
Come and get it.
Just give it to me!!
Just come and get it...right here!
DON'T, come on!!!
Did you see the winning run score?
You're not making sense. Make sense.
Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.
In the can. That the money?
I have been in love with you for so long.
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
Maybe.
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
Total delirium.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Push 'em back.
Help me!
No.
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Maybe... I... don't...
What about Philip Swann?
I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
What's the matter with them?
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
At four. He will be there at four.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
I'm not going alone!
Who?
Guess.
How should I know?
Someone from the past.
Who?
Give up?
YES.
Maxine.
Not the Maxine?
Yup.
God, how horrifying.
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
I hope you liked it.
Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
Why do you ask?
I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
This gonna get you in trouble?
Not if no one finds out.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
What list?
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
I don't... think so.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
Well, I have to file a claim...
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Don't I?
Do what you like.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
A hotel?
Yeah.
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
I don't follow...
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
Huh?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
No, I...
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
Yes, you can.
Thank you.
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
What's that?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
What?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Look, your trespassing.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
No.
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
I don't understa-
And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other.
I thought that was in detail.
<i>I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.</i>
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
I'm tryin' to.
Sure.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
What went off?
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
After all I've done for you --
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
It's happening right now.
It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
They're holding position.
And?
They will obey, Praetor.
It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
I need it.
'Least you admit it.
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
She's the Scream Queen.
Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
It was my mother's.
It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.
How do you know what my father thought - -
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life you've ruined mine 
You were father's secretary - I never thought - -
Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
Come on!
Yeah.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
Oh! Italian, right?
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
Oh, yeah?
And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.
I haven't forgotten.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
I-I c-can't...
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
This is all the exercise I need...
What's a ditty again?
It's like a song.
Oh.
All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
And it killed Bo?
No...she killed herself.
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
You's better believe it, brother!
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
Always the drugs.
What?
I saw you talking to my Mom.
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
That's right...
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
No. No you're not.
What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.
Mr. Dumbarton.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Maybe.
Don't you care?
There's very little I can do about it.
Maybe we should just leave --
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --
I need a skin. Then we leave --
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
I like an olive.

Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.

Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?

What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Tell me.

--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
Joyce was screwing Del.
...among others.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
The same, your Majesty.
He tried.  It didn't take.
Where is she?
Yeah?
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Thanks.
Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
I was sitting there.
Enough.
What is it, Hal?
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Burn them.
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
I can't do it.
You positive about that?
It's a different kind of deal.

How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?

Finished?
He's gone.

What are you talking about?

Yes, my bag!
Didn't you take it with you?
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
No--I'm sorry.
But you saw it here.
Yes, I saw it--but--
Well, where is it?
So what's the argument?
No argument.
Oh Christ. Julia...
What?
Not <u>they</u>... <u>he</u>...
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Why don't you come back with me?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Go away! Leave me alone.
One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
Weirder than this?
Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
What?
We're half a million off.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
I don't give a shit.  Close enough.
I'm -- I'm fine.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
Wait -- hold on a minute --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
What day?
How long was I gone?
Not until he has the money!
Good-bye, Peter.
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
I might have to look into that...
So where is the lamb?
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
Only to see.
Can't you get contacts?
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
Are you staying?
I think I should, don't you?
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
What?
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
What was her name?
What's your name?
Thank you.
Go start picking up the pieces.  We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
I wouldn't say encouraged.
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Not in those words.
So the defendant was encouraged to hope.  Or could have been.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Look over there.
Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
You rat.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Nothing.
Hear, hear...
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
You were great.
No! I want to talk about it now!
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Why not?!
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
No reply, Chekov... Continue on course...
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Good Lord!
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
What do you mean? I'm starving.
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
Who at?
I don't know.
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
They're scared? What about me! I'm sick of this shit man, I'm sick of this shit! They don't want us here! Who do you think they're fighting for! GET OUTTA THERE!
What are you talking about?
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
And you gonna live it with him?
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
I want you to come.
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
--one of us, all of us--I have no idea--brought whatever this thing is back here. We're not going to go out there and spread it around like Typhoid Mary. We're gonna figure it out, we're gonna bring a goddamn <u>end</u> to it.
Twelve seconds...!
Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers...!
Your back? Did you fall?
Pass.
Sarge?
What are you talking about?
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
I'm real sorry.  In a while, you're gone from this country. But we live here.  No one wants to mix it up with those hombres.
Do you want her to join us sometime?
Neither did I!
Yes?
Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
I'm on my way.
What am I supposed to do?
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
A... I gotta go.
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
No.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right?
Harold!
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Japanese stick-fighting.  They're trained as kids, y'know.  To kill with sticks.
There's the fence...
Isn't this how your story goes?
We don't need guns.
I think we might.
He didn't say we need guns.
He implied it.
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds."  How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
That whole...
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
You don't understand.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Will you let me explain!
And what're you whispering for?
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
I never do business in Cuba.  And nobody goes to Cuba but me.  And he is not my husband...
What?
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Computer guy.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really.
A record of the arrests...
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing.
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.
I don't know what you mean.
I mean, did you ask her?  What kind of drugs has she tried?
Who?
How you, Radar?
I'm going.
You guys are so sweet!
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days.
You can't help me, man.
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
La de da da...
You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
Oh yeah?
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it.
Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
Good and evil; there is never one without the other.
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
What are you talking about -- who?
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
Fuck you!
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Where are we ?
How long they been livin' here?
You hear that question, Garcia?
What, Sergeant?
Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...  ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
